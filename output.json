Thank you so much for being here today."}], "text": " With over two decades, we're in the environmental consulting and local government fields. From leading waste reduction programs on the Sometime Coast, to championing natural asset management in Gibson's to advocating for public transit and the infrastructure, Jeremy's career has been rooted in sustainability. And now, as the first BC Green member elected on the mainland, he's helping shape a new chapter in the party. So in a session, we'll hear from Jeremy. on the direction that the meeting greens are headed in, the party's clean energy priorities, and we'll also dive into how those policies intersect with the realities. Many of us are not meeting on the ground, from permitting to procurement to indigenous partnerships and economic realities. So with that, you join me in welcoming Jeremy Perry. Thanks, Nina. So I'm really happy to be here and it's very familiar to me because as a young engineer and environmental consultant in the 2000s I used to attend these conferences back when it was IPB.C. Some of you probably remember that. I do see a few familiar faces. So it's great to be brought up speed and it's great to be on the cusp of a new age for this industry. I know that 15 years has been a long time but there's a lot of excitement in this room. So I got to work on small hydro projects in the club and valley, the upper bridge, the Vancouver Island, and up north as I'm working on environmental mitigation and engineering constraints. So, and now I'm an elected representative for the BC Greens. A bit of a strange journey through local government, but we've elected two green MLAs. Neither of us returning were brand new, so we're in a steep learning curve. but right after the election, very tight election as you remember, we were thrown into a negotiation with the government to support them on budget and confidence motions and we were able to agree on a series of projects that we were going to work on together, shared priorities, health, housing transit, and for us electoral form. The one that's probably most interest to you is a full review of the Clean BC climate plan, which is a year ahead of schedule and we agreed the science is moving quickly. the needs for energy are changing quickly. So we've worked very closely with Minister Dix to establish in terms of reference and then select expert panelists. Marion Smith and Dan Vanilovich probably don't need any introduction in this room, but they bring a lot of expertise to this table. And so with input from stakeholders and the public and the Climate Solutions Council, they are doing a full review that's supposed to be. finished by October. So I know people think of a review as a bit of a yonner and won't produce anything to you, but this is a pretty critical stage for our climate plan. As you know, we haven't been meeting our targets and we've unfortunately in a bit of a lull in terms of public enthusiasm for climate action. I'm hoping and I'm very confident that it's cyclable and we will resume our focus on climate when we get through some of these other challenges that we're facing. But we're not meeting on target so we need to figure out how to do that. So updating from the 2018 plan and the scope for these reviewers is everything's everything's on the table. We're looking for a transformative change. We're looking for a paradigm shift and how we tackle climate and this industry will be a huge part of that. I'm not going to prejudge their results, but I know that electrification will be a major push. So we're really excited for the previous. call to power and the one that's coming up. All of you are leading the way in this and government should be listening to you. I'm really encouraged to hear some of the earlier presentations. We're beating IEA projections for solar. First Nations financing seems to be making major strides. So what are Green Caucus things that we need is an overarching vision for power in this province instead of lurching from call to call 15 years apart and rebates. get canceled, we need a big picture of Energy Pathways Assessment. And so a lot has been done. There's been a big rush that tariff threat has caused this government to move quickly. And in some ways that can be good. I have lived the permitting germann't, or sorry, the permitting gauntlet of 15 different ministries and 15 different permits. I'm glad to see a one window option. as we all know the PC Energy regular hasn't been involved in this before so we're very concerned to see what their process will look like and how they'll talk about this and it's great to have the Michelle speak to that earlier. So we're looking at proposed legislation from this government that has some pretty significant changes about how energy projects are assessed including the major North Coast Transmission line. So if it promotes streamlining and it creates a one window that's That's great, but we also need to make sure that we don't rush to get this wrong. So we need to get this right. And I know we all, and I share the frustration the government can move quite slowly. But to take some of these bills, Bill 7 is the most notable one that you'll have heard of. Bills 14 and 15 are streamlining but concentrating a huge amount of power in the cabinet rather than putting it through the legislature and your duly elected representatives. So to think that these from a draft 10 days ago to be law by the end of May that is extremely quick and we believe that they need the proper screening. So that's our job to make sure that we don't sacrifice the rigor of environmental assessment and the social license that we all know that we get from proper consultation. So I can't stress enough that the great, BC Greens, obviously support development of renewable energy and our support support. of ways to speed this up so we can get these things built. But we are very wary of living too fast and seeing a social backlash. And we know that there is resistance to some communities, some communities. So you bring communities along, allow First Nations to participate, and those are key to success. We haven't heard that from some of the stakeholders so far. So we'll be examining the extent of this bill and these bills and trying to figure out to make them work. So if I don't, yeah, I'm not here to monologue. Actually, I think ENA has one question, but I'd actually like to hear some questions for you, but I'd also want to have statements in the formal questions because really you are the experts, you've been dealing with this regulatory regime and this industry for years, and I'd like to know how the province can harness the potential that's in this room. And this really, energy should be nonpartisan. This is about how we, this is the way forward. We don't know this is the way forward and we have to, we have some catching up to do, but it should not be driven by partisanship. So please think of a question or a statement. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the bringing in a BC energy regulator and some of the other industry conditions and constraints. But I'll go ahead and take one question first. was really eager to hear from the room so I'll ask my one and then we'll open it up to the floor. So thank you so much Jeremy. There's obviously a lot of thought going into the Greens approach and I know that everyone in the room is eager to connect that vision to the work that we're doing in the clean energy sector so especially when it comes to delivering projects on the ground. So my one question before we turn to the floor. Your election 2024, most recently, last fall, rightly identified the election platform document that your party put out, rightly identified the need for long-term procurement targets and workforce development. As someone trying to plan and finance these projects, I say predictability is everything. So what would a stable investor-friendly clean energy plan look like from a easy green perspective? One that is one that delivers both on climate outcomes and economic certainty. I know what's your plan. Yeah, I mean, I think we all know that predictability is key and like I've said, lurching between cultural power every 15 years, it's, it's, you know, it doesn't work. I think, you know, the key piece for us is, like I said, government needs to articulate a vision and how we're going to get there. I think, you know, like any enterprise there should be, you know, there needs to be targets that we actually make the climate targets are excessively frustrating because there's really no consequences to not meeting them and that's really not the way we should be. They need to be linked to some kind of consequences. We're extremely keen on supporting technological innovation. So the fact that geothermal and battery storage is included in this call is really, really important and all the other innovation that's taking place. We've just heard a whole lot about solar and energy and energy co-ops. We do have a paradox shift debate in this province. It's not all resource extraction. We can be a clean, Canada can be an energy superpower. We need to look at domestic use. And then the certainty that comes with funding and training and job creation, we'll hear about skilled trades. So we need to set the foundation for this now. I mean, we need to be setting it five to ten years ago and that's the. That's where we need to say, we know where we're going, DC Hydro, may be building a big hydropower dam, but we know we're going to need more energy. And so this, you know, we saw the curves versus the IEA projections on solar, and I think we need to be bullish about planning for this future and be bold. Any questions from the floor or should it go to the rest of the questions? Thanks for sticking with us to the end of the day. So you touched on it a little bit, but let's expand on it a little bit further. Given today's geopolitical and economic uncertainties, energy security is coming in more and more. How did the Greens view energy sovereignty and what role should renewable energy play in strengthening? important and you know in the discussions about an East Coast East-West energy grid I think and every in this crisis does create an opportunity for us to to find those and part of part of bill seven was is about decreasing into provincial trade barriers I guess I just want to draw the distinction between energy sovereignty and home and the supply of energy that we need here versus massive exports of gas Yeah, so to the greens, that is, that's a climate disaster and it's not necessarily part of our energy sovereignty. We'd like to look within our borders, use the resources that we have here to strengthen that sovereignty and move forward with that. It's not necessarily about export. And I think the transition is key to where we land in this. back away from renewables, then maybe that's an opportunity for us. I know you're not all seeing that on the ground yet, but that's what we would hope to create those conditions that allow that to happen. Okay, thank you. I see through the, uh, that we've got one question that's come in. So, question is, what specifically do the BC Greens want to change with Bill 14? Is there a balance between regulatory efficiency and environmental protections? Yeah, thanks. That's a great question. It's trying to achieve that. that balance. And Bill 14 is, I'll say, less challenging for us than Bill 15, because Bill 15 is just a blanket cabinet determines what's a significant project and it goes ahead. It can be a very streamlined environmental assessment process that is essentially what Cabinet decides. Bill 14 is, you know, it's about renewable energy, so we are trying to be supportive. We're trying to work our ways through it. But the changes that we want to really about transparency and oversight. If the B.C. Energy Regulator is going to regulate these, that's great. They're currently not as transparent as they say the Environmental Assessment Office. But also the cabinet decisions that are going to set that process need to be, need to be transparent and they need to be accountable. It's, you know, with Bill 7, we agreed that we would have a legislative committee of all parties and make it nonpartisan, have a look at the regulations after their, the opportunity to point out what's not working, find the unintended consequences and maybe change course. If it's all done behind closed doors in the cabinet, then that's not going to work. That's going to build more mistrust in government and it's going to create more of a backlash, which I don't want any of you to see because I think these projects are really important. So the balance is more about transparency and oversight of making sure that these processes don't get short circumstances. and to the detriment of really all of us. Okay, thank you. I think we've got time for just one last quick follow-up question. It's actually a question that I've put together and I feel like it goes hand in hand with the one that was just asked. Specifically around, I feel like your party has been a little bit critical, I watch question period and I've seen some of the remarks or heard some of the remarks with regard to the most recent procurement, pricing, so on and so forth and obviously permitting. reform as someone working directly in the industry and sector I'm curious who are you consulting with to form these positions are you talking to developers and indigenous nations as partners local communities as part of that dialogue or does it mostly happen within the policy of advocacy sphere in circles? Yeah great question Victoria can be a bit of a bubble and that's you know I've spent a lot of time there in the last few months and I'm looking forward to getting back to get grounded in the sky and the rest of the province. So there is some policy pieces that is a bit disconnected in Victoria. I've heard from some developers. I'm here to put my name out there to hear from more.
