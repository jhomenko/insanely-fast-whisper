1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
With over two decades working in the environmental consulting and local government fields.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,080
From leading waste reduction programs on the Sunshine Coast,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,020
to championing natural asset management in Gibsons,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,500
to advocating for public transit and EV infrastructure,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,300
Jeremy's career has been rooted in sustainability.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,540
And now, as the first BC Green member elected on the mainland,

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,420
he's helping shape a new chapter for the party.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,840
So in this session, we'll hear from Jeremy on his reflections on the direction that the BC Greens are headed in,

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,540
the party's clean energy priorities, and we'll also dive into how those policies intersect with the realities

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,000
many of us are navigating on the ground.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,380
From permitting to procurement, to indigenous partnerships, and economic realities.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,240
So with that, please join me in welcoming Jeremy and Mary.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,980
Thanks. Okay, that works.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,580
Thanks, Ina.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,080
So I'm really happy to be here, and it's very familiar to me because as a young engineer and environmental consultant,

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,740
in the 2000s, I used to attend these conferences back when it was IPBBC.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,520
Some of you probably remember that, and I do see a few familiar faces.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,860
So it's great to be brought up to speed, and it's great to be on the cusp of a new age for this industry.

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,920
I know that 15 years has been a long time, but there's a lot of excitement in this room.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,140
So I got to work on small hydro projects in the Cleveland Valley, the Upper Bridge, Vancouver Island,

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,940
and up north as working on environmental mitigation and engineering constraints.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,260
So, and now I'm an elected representative for the BC Greens.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,220
It's a bit of a strange journey through local government, but we've elected two Green MLAs.

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,420
Neither of us returning.

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,960
We're brand new, so we're in a steep learning curve.

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,840
But right after the election, very tight election, as you remember, we were thrown into a negotiation with the government

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,540
to support them on budget and confidence motions, and we were able to agree on a series of projects

28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,240
that we were going to work on together, shared priorities, health, housing, transit, forests, electoral reform.

29
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,960
The one that's probably of most interest to you is a full review of the Clean BC Climate Plan,

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,140
which is a year ahead of schedule, and we agreed the science is moving quickly.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,660
We, the needs for energy are changing quickly.

32
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,660
So we've worked very closely with Minister Dix to establish some terms of reference

33
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,540
and then select expert panelists.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,840
Maren Smith and Dan Vanilovic probably don't need any introduction in this room,

35
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,020
but they bring a lot of expertise to this table.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,680
And so with input from stakeholders and the public and the Climate Solutions Council,

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,680
they are doing a full review that's supposed to be finished by October.

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,820
So I know people think of a review as a bit of a yawner and won't produce anything for you,

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,960
but this is a pretty critical stage for our climate plan.

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,220
As you know, we haven't been meeting our targets.

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,100
And we've unfortunately in a bit of a lull in terms of public enthusiasm for climate action.

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:27,020
I'm hoping and I'm very confident that it's cyclical and we will resume our focus on climate

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,540
when we get through some of these other challenges that we're facing.

44
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,560
But we're not meeting our targets and we need to figure out how to do that.

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,960
So updating from the 2018 plan and the scope for these reviewers is everything's on the table.

46
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,840
We're looking for a transformative change.

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,600
We're looking for a paradigm shift in how we tackle climate.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,540
And this industry will be a huge part of that.

49
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm not going to prejudge their results, but I know that electrification will be a major push.

50
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,040
So we're really excited for the previous call to power and the one that's coming up.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,500
All of you are leading the way in this.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,320
And government should be listening to you.

53
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm really encouraged to hear some of the earlier presentations.

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,620
We're beating IEA projections for solar.

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,140
First Nations financing seems to be making major strides.

56
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:26,200
So what our Green Caucus thinks that we need is an overarching vision for power in this province.

57
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,800
Instead of lurching from call to call 15 years apart and rebates get brought in, rebates get cancelled,

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,260
we need a big picture energy pathways assessment.

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,000
And so a lot has been done.

60
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,740
There's been a big rush.

61
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,140
The tariff threat has caused this government to move quickly.

62
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,100
And in some ways that can be good.

63
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:55,160
But I have lived the permitting juggernaut, or sorry, the permitting gauntlet of 15 different ministries and 15 different permits.

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm glad to see a one-window option.

65
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,340
As we all know, the BC Energy Regulatory hasn't been involved in this before,

66
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,820
so we're very concerned to see what their process will look like and how they'll tackle this.

67
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,960
And it's great to have Michelle speak to that earlier.

68
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,340
So we're looking at proposed legislation from this government that has some pretty significant changes

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,700
about how energy projects are assessed, including the major North Coast transmission line.

70
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,340
So if it promotes streamlining and it creates a one-window, that's great.

71
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,440
But we also need to make sure that we don't rush to get this wrong.

72
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,520
So we need to get this right.

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,040
And I know we all, and I share the frustration, the government moves can move quite slowly.

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,360
But to take some of these bills, Bill 7 is the most notable one that you'll have heard of.

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,960
Bills 14 and 15 are streamlining but concentrating a huge amount of power in the cabinet

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,420
rather than putting it through the legislature when you're duly elected representatives.

77
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:06,580
So to think that these bills will go from a draft 10 days ago to being law by the end of May,

78
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,520
that is extremely quick, and we believe that they need the proper screening.

79
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,600
So that's our job, to make sure that we don't sacrifice the rigor of environmental assessment

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,580
and the social license that we all know that we get from proper consultation.

81
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,640
So I can't stress enough that the B.C. Greens obviously support development of renewable energy

82
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,040
and are supportive of ways to speed this up so we can get these things built.

83
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,980
But we are very wary of living too fast and seeing a social backlash.

84
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,900
And we know that there is resistance to some of these, some communities.

85
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,540
So you bring communities along, allow First Nations to participate, and those are key to success.

86
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,060
We haven't heard that from some of the stakeholders so far, so we'll be examining the extent of this bill

87
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,560
and these bills and trying to figure out how to make them work.

88
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,180
So I don't, yeah, I'm not here to monologue.

89
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,920
Actually, I think Ina has one question, but I'd actually like to hear some questions from you,

90
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,060
but I also want to have statements in the form of questions because really you are the experts.

91
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,520
You've been dealing with this regulatory regime and this industry for years,

92
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,540
and I'd like to know how the province can harness the potential that's in this room.

93
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
And this really, clean energy should be non-partisan.

94
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,160
This is about how we, this is the way forward.

95
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,600
We all know this is the way forward, and we have to, we have some catching up to do.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,980
But it should not be driven by partisanship.

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,140
So please think of a question or a statement.

98
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,380
I'd like to hear your thoughts on the bringing in of the BC Energy Regulator

99
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,740
and some of the other industry conditions and constraints.

100
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,860
And I'll go ahead and take one question first.

101
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,100
Okay, sounds good.

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,940
I did have five questions prepared, but Amelie Valeria was really eager to hear from the room,

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,560
so I'll ask my one, and then we'll open it up to the floor.

104
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,640
So thank you so much, Jeremy.

105
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,360
There's obviously a lot of thought going into the Greens approach,

106
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,320
and I know that everyone in the room is eager to connect that vision

107
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,200
to the work that we're doing in the clean energy sector,

108
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,260
so especially when it comes to delivering projects on the ground.

109
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,520
So my one question before we turn to the floor.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,980
Your election 2024, most recently, last fall,

111
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,460
rightly identified the election platform document that your party put out,

112
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,900
rightly identified the need for long-term procurement targets

113
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,640
and workforce development.

114
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,260
As someone trying to plan and finance these projects,

115
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I say predictability is everything.

116
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,540
So what would a stable, investor-friendly, clean energy plan look like

117
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,600
from a BC Green perspective,

118
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,920
one that delivers both on climate outcomes and economic certainty?

119
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,680
I know you touched on it a little bit, but let us know.

120
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,460
What's your plan?

121
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,120
Yeah, I mean, I think we all know that predictability is key,

122
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,740
and it's, like I've said, lurching between calls for power every 15 years

123
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,020
doesn't work.

124
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,960
I think, you know, the key piece for us is, like I said,

125
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,760
government needs to articulate a vision and how we're going to get there.

126
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,360
I think, you know, like any enterprise, there should be,

127
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,400
you know, there needs to be targets that we actually make.

128
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,600
The climate targets are excessively frustrating

129
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
because there's really no consequences to not meeting them,

130
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
and that's really not the way that we should be.

131
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,420
They need to be linked to some kind of consequences.

132
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,060
We're extremely keen on supporting technological innovation,

133
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,560
so, you know, the fact that geothermal and battery storage

134
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,660
is included in this call is really, really important,

135
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,020
and all the other innovation that's taking place.

136
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,200
We've just heard a whole lot about solar and energy,

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,500
community energy co-ops.

138
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,780
We do have a paradigm shift to make in this province.

139
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,740
It's not all resource extraction.

140
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,240
We can be a clean Canada, can be an energy superpower.

141
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,880
We need to look at domestic use,

142
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,120
and then the certainty that comes with funding and training

143
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,620
and job creation, we'll hear about skilled trades,

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,860
so we need to set the foundation for this now.

145
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,300
I mean, well, we needed to be setting it five to ten years ago,

146
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,400
and that's where we need to say,

147
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,460
we know where we're going.

148
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,840
BC Hydro might be building a big hydro-powered dam,

149
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,440
but we know we're going to need more energy,

150
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,760
and so this, you know, we saw the curves

151
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,300
versus the IEA projections on solar,

152
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,820
and I think we need to be bullish about planning for this for the future,

153
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,640
and be bold.

154
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,980
Any questions from the floor,

155
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,940
or should I go to the rest of the questions?

156
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,600
Well, it's a good thing I prepped five.

157
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,500
Thanks for sticking with us to the end of the day.

158
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,980
So you touched on it a little bit,

159
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,160
but let's expand on it a little bit further.

160
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,480
Given today's geopolitical and economic uncertainties,

161
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,580
energy security is coming up more and more.

162
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,180
How do the Greens view energy sovereignty,

163
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,740
and what role should renewable energy play

164
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,980
in strengthening BC's self-sufficiency?

165
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,100
Yeah, I mean, energy security, energy sovereignty,

166
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,420
and sovereignty is clearly important,

167
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,640
and, you know, in the discussions about an east-west energy grid,

168
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,740
I think, you know, and this crisis does create an opportunity

169
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,980
for us to find those,

170
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,580
and, you know, part of Bill 7

171
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,260
is about decreasing inter-provincial trade barriers.

172
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,560
I guess I just want to draw the distinction

173
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,920
between energy sovereignty and home,

174
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,500
and the supply of energy that we need here

175
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,520
versus massive exports of gas,

176
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,220
of the provide gas.

177
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,360
So to the Greens, that's a climate disaster,

178
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,960
and it's not necessarily part of our energy sovereignty.

179
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,000
We'd like to live within our borders,

180
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,560
you know, use the resources that we have here

181
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,640
to strengthen that sovereignty

182
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,300
and move forward with that.

183
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,140
It's not necessarily about export.

184
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,880
And I think, you know, the transition is key

185
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,600
to where we land in this.

186
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,080
If the U.S. is going to back away from renewables,

187
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,920
then maybe that's an opportunity for us.

188
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,420
I know you're not all seeing that on the ground yet,

189
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,740
but that's what we would hope to, you know,

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,520
create those conditions that allow that to happen.

191
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,620
Okay, thank you.

192
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,780
I see that we've got one question that's come in.

193
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,420
So the question is,

194
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,640
what specifically do the B.C. Greens want to change

195
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
with Bill 14?

196
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,060
Is there a balance between regulatory efficiency

197
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,240
and environmental protections?

198
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,660
Yeah, thanks.

199
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,040
That's a great question.

200
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,800
It's trying to achieve that balance.

201
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,620
And Bill 14 is, I'll say,

202
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,840
less challenging for us than Bill 15

203
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,100
because Bill 15 is just a blanket cabinet

204
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
that determines what's a significant project

205
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,160
and it goes ahead.

206
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,060
It could be a very streamlined environmental assessment process

207
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,660
that is essentially what cabinets,

208
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
cabinet decides.

209
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,940
Bill 14 is, you know,

210
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,900
it's about renewable energy,

211
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,500
so we are trying to be supportive.

212
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,720
We're trying to work our ways through it.

213
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,840
But the changes that we want

214
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,940
are really about transparency and oversight.

215
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,620
If, you know,

216
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,060
if B.C. Energy regulator is going to regulate these,

217
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,500
that's great.

218
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,140
They're currently not as transparent

219
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,940
as, say, the Environmental Assessment Office,

220
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,220
but also the cabinet decisions

221
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,720
that are going to set that process

222
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,380
need to be transparent

223
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,620
and they need to be accountable.

224
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,720
It's, you know,

225
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,320
with Bill 7,

226
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,360
we agreed that we would

227
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,920
have a legislative committee of all parties

228
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,000
to make it nonpartisan,

229
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,440
have a look at the regulations

230
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,900
after they're established.

231
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,500
And at least that gives the opportunity

232
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,060
to point out what's not working,

233
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,700
find the unintended consequences

234
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,940
and maybe change course.

235
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,380
If it's all done behind closed doors

236
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,800
of the cabinet,

237
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,720
then that's not going to work.

238
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,100
It's not,

239
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,160
that's going to build more mistrust

240
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,560
in government

241
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,920
and it's going to create more of a backlash,

242
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,200
which I don't want any of you to see

243
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
because I think these projects

244
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,180
are really important.

245
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,420
So the balance is more about transparency

246
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,260
and oversight of making sure

247
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,040
that these processes

248
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,200
don't get short-circuited

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
and to the detriment

250
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,700
of really all of us.

251
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,480
Okay, thank you.

252
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,960
I think we've got time

253
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,300
for just one last quick follow-up question.

254
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,720
It's actually a question

255
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,460
that I put together

256
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,300
and I feel like it goes hand-in-hand

257
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
with the one that was just asked.

258
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,540
Specifically around,

259
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,480
I feel like your party

260
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,520
has been a little bit critical.

261
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,980
I watch for the question period

262
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,660
and I've seen some of the remarks

263
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,840
or heard some of the remarks

264
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,940
with regard to the most recent procurement,

265
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,280
pricing, so on and so forth,

266
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
and obviously permitting reform.

267
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,980
As someone working directly

268
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
in the industry and sector,

269
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm curious,

270
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,600
who are you consulting with

271
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,040
to form these positions?

272
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,740
Are you talking to developers,

273
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,080
Indigenous nations as partners,

274
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,940
local communities as part of that dialogue

275
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,620
or does it mostly happen

276
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,900
within the policy and advocacy sphere

277
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,600
and circles?

278
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,660
Yeah, great question.

279
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,160
Victoria can be a bit of a bubble

280
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
and that's, you know,

281
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,920
I've spent a lot of time there

282
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,620
in the last few months

283
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,300
and I'm looking forward

284
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,280
to getting back to,

285
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,520
back to, you know,

286
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,760
get grounded in the sea and sky

287
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,960
and the rest of the province.

288
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,800
So there is,

289
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,240
there is some, you know,

290
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,760
policy pieces

291
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
that is a bit disconnected

292
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,300
in Victoria.

293
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,680
I've heard from some developers

294
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,340
and I'm here to, you know,

295
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,860
put my name out there

296
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,940
and hear from more.

297
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,240
I would say we take most

298
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,840
of our guidance

299
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,060
at this time

300
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,500
from First Nations.

301
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,200
So for example,

302
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,140
Union of BC and Indian Chiefs

303
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,060
has come out strongly

304
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,180
on Bill 15

305
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,560
and we believe

306
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,040
that they have,

307
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,920
they really have a strong argument

308
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,740
to make about

309
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,380
the free prior

310
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,120
and informed consent

311
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,500
and participation.

312
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,380
Same with First Nations

313
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,100
Leadership Council

314
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,960
and then when it comes

315
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,480
to some of these

316
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,920
local governments

317
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,240
are also, you know,

318
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,960
throwing up caution.

319
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,200
Not so much

320
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,140
about the renewable energy

321
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,000
Bill 14

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,380
but about Bill 15

323
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,680
and the infrastructure

324
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,160
projects in general

325
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,560
kind of steamrolling

326
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,300
little governments

327
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,660
has been done

328
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,180
in the past

329
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,060
and I would argue

330
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,720
it's not good

331
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,180
for the overall process.

332
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,600
I don't think

333
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,280
it's good for business.

334
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,020
I don't think

335
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,920
it's good for,

336
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,220
you know,

337
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,820
public trust

338
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,020
and institutions.

339
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,860
So, yeah,

340
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,140
the people

341
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,820
that we're listening

342
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,140
to are, you know,

343
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,760
to some degree

344
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,060
you're kind of

345
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,940
typical green advisors

346
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,460
but we,

347
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,440
my job,

348
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,120
you know,

349
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,300
I got into this

350
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,200
because I thought

351
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,940
we needed more people

352
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,180
with a technical background,

353
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,740
more engineers

354
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,260
and scientists

355
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,880
and politics

356
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,280
and so

357
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,240
I don't listen

358
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
to anybody

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
and if there's

360
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,540
proponents

361
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,060
that have,

362
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,460
you know,

363
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,340
really strong opinions

364
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,880
about how this

365
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,300
should be done

366
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,120
I would love

367
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,160
to hear from you

368
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,940
and I've got some cards

369
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,780
and you can find me

370
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,580
online

371
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,720
but it is really

372
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,420
important to hear

373
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,580
the people doing it

374
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:11,920
on the ground

375
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,480
there are people

376
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:12,800
who are sitting

377
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,220
in offices

378
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,020
as we all know

379
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,220
who haven't done

380
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,020
this work

381
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,200
and they need

382
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,800
to hear from you

383
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,060
and sometimes

384
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,860
that can be

385
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,240
really difficult

386
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,620
to get that message

387
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:22,860
through

388
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,460
so I'm open

389
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,980
to hearing more

390
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,380
and I think

391
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
that's kind of key

392
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,040
that's what government

393
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,720
needs to do too

394
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,200
and sometimes

395
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,800
we get on this

396
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,040
ideological track

397
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,100
and we get tunnel

398
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,620
vision on what

399
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,100
we should do

400
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,820
and we're just

401
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,260
trying to make sure

402
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,800
that doesn't happen.

403
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,820
Thank you very much.

404
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,800
So, I'm afraid

405
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,320
that that's all

406
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,620
the time

407
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,260
that we have.

408
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,080
Jeremy, thank you

409
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,520
so much

410
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,100
for being here today.

411
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,940
we appreciate it.

412
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:45,980
Thank you.

413
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,880
Thank you.

414
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:46,940
Thank you.

415
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,020
Thank you.

416
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,100
Thank you.
