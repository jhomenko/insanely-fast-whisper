0	4360	With over two decades working in the environmental consulting and local government fields.
5120	9080	From leading waste reduction programs on the Sunshine Coast,
9420	13020	to championing natural asset management in Gibsons,
13300	16500	to advocating for public transit and EV infrastructure,
17160	19300	Jeremy's career has been rooted in sustainability.
20600	24540	And now, as the first BC Green member elected on the mainland,
24920	27420	he's helping shape a new chapter for the party.
27420	33840	So in this session, we'll hear from Jeremy on his reflections on the direction that the BC Greens are headed in,
34320	41540	the party's clean energy priorities, and we'll also dive into how those policies intersect with the realities
41540	44000	many of us are navigating on the ground.
44520	49380	From permitting to procurement, to indigenous partnerships, and economic realities.
50420	53240	So with that, please join me in welcoming Jeremy and Mary.
57420	59980	Thanks. Okay, that works.
61060	61580	Thanks, Ina.
62600	69080	So I'm really happy to be here, and it's very familiar to me because as a young engineer and environmental consultant,
69340	73740	in the 2000s, I used to attend these conferences back when it was IPBBC.
73960	77520	Some of you probably remember that, and I do see a few familiar faces.
77520	83860	So it's great to be brought up to speed, and it's great to be on the cusp of a new age for this industry.
84140	89920	I know that 15 years has been a long time, but there's a lot of excitement in this room.
90240	97140	So I got to work on small hydro projects in the Cleveland Valley, the Upper Bridge, Vancouver Island,
97140	104940	and up north as working on environmental mitigation and engineering constraints.
105280	110260	So, and now I'm an elected representative for the BC Greens.
110700	116220	It's a bit of a strange journey through local government, but we've elected two Green MLAs.
116560	117420	Neither of us returning.
117640	119960	We're brand new, so we're in a steep learning curve.
119960	126840	But right after the election, very tight election, as you remember, we were thrown into a negotiation with the government
126840	132540	to support them on budget and confidence motions, and we were able to agree on a series of projects
132540	139240	that we were going to work on together, shared priorities, health, housing, transit, forests, electoral reform.
139300	143960	The one that's probably of most interest to you is a full review of the Clean BC Climate Plan,
143960	149140	which is a year ahead of schedule, and we agreed the science is moving quickly.
149140	152660	We, the needs for energy are changing quickly.
152780	157660	So we've worked very closely with Minister Dix to establish some terms of reference
157660	159540	and then select expert panelists.
160500	167840	Maren Smith and Dan Vanilovic probably don't need any introduction in this room,
167940	172020	but they bring a lot of expertise to this table.
172640	176680	And so with input from stakeholders and the public and the Climate Solutions Council,
176680	180680	they are doing a full review that's supposed to be finished by October.
180820	185820	So I know people think of a review as a bit of a yawner and won't produce anything for you,
185880	188960	but this is a pretty critical stage for our climate plan.
189320	192220	As you know, we haven't been meeting our targets.
192220	199100	And we've unfortunately in a bit of a lull in terms of public enthusiasm for climate action.
199100	207020	I'm hoping and I'm very confident that it's cyclical and we will resume our focus on climate
207020	209540	when we get through some of these other challenges that we're facing.
209540	213560	But we're not meeting our targets and we need to figure out how to do that.
213680	221960	So updating from the 2018 plan and the scope for these reviewers is everything's on the table.
222140	223840	We're looking for a transformative change.
224320	227600	We're looking for a paradigm shift in how we tackle climate.
227600	230540	And this industry will be a huge part of that.
230620	236640	I'm not going to prejudge their results, but I know that electrification will be a major push.
236760	242040	So we're really excited for the previous call to power and the one that's coming up.
242160	244500	All of you are leading the way in this.
244560	246320	And government should be listening to you.
247060	249720	I'm really encouraged to hear some of the earlier presentations.
250100	252620	We're beating IEA projections for solar.
253700	257140	First Nations financing seems to be making major strides.
257140	266200	So what our Green Caucus thinks that we need is an overarching vision for power in this province.
266300	271800	Instead of lurching from call to call 15 years apart and rebates get brought in, rebates get cancelled,
272360	275260	we need a big picture energy pathways assessment.
275460	278000	And so a lot has been done.
278460	279740	There's been a big rush.
279940	283140	The tariff threat has caused this government to move quickly.
283940	285100	And in some ways that can be good.
285100	295160	But I have lived the permitting juggernaut, or sorry, the permitting gauntlet of 15 different ministries and 15 different permits.
296160	298440	I'm glad to see a one-window option.
300340	303340	As we all know, the BC Energy Regulatory hasn't been involved in this before,
303340	307820	so we're very concerned to see what their process will look like and how they'll tackle this.
307900	311960	And it's great to have Michelle speak to that earlier.
311960	318340	So we're looking at proposed legislation from this government that has some pretty significant changes
318340	324700	about how energy projects are assessed, including the major North Coast transmission line.
324700	330340	So if it promotes streamlining and it creates a one-window, that's great.
330420	334440	But we also need to make sure that we don't rush to get this wrong.
334560	336520	So we need to get this right.
336520	342040	And I know we all, and I share the frustration, the government moves can move quite slowly.
342960	347360	But to take some of these bills, Bill 7 is the most notable one that you'll have heard of.
347500	353960	Bills 14 and 15 are streamlining but concentrating a huge amount of power in the cabinet
353960	357420	rather than putting it through the legislature when you're duly elected representatives.
357420	366580	So to think that these bills will go from a draft 10 days ago to being law by the end of May,
366640	370520	that is extremely quick, and we believe that they need the proper screening.
371660	377600	So that's our job, to make sure that we don't sacrifice the rigor of environmental assessment
377600	381580	and the social license that we all know that we get from proper consultation.
381580	387640	So I can't stress enough that the B.C. Greens obviously support development of renewable energy
387640	393040	and are supportive of ways to speed this up so we can get these things built.
393860	399980	But we are very wary of living too fast and seeing a social backlash.
400240	403900	And we know that there is resistance to some of these, some communities.
404020	410540	So you bring communities along, allow First Nations to participate, and those are key to success.
410540	417060	We haven't heard that from some of the stakeholders so far, so we'll be examining the extent of this bill
417060	422560	and these bills and trying to figure out how to make them work.
422840	426180	So I don't, yeah, I'm not here to monologue.
426360	433920	Actually, I think Ina has one question, but I'd actually like to hear some questions from you,
433980	438060	but I also want to have statements in the form of questions because really you are the experts.
438060	442520	You've been dealing with this regulatory regime and this industry for years,
442700	447540	and I'd like to know how the province can harness the potential that's in this room.
448080	451680	And this really, clean energy should be non-partisan.
451840	454160	This is about how we, this is the way forward.
454260	457600	We all know this is the way forward, and we have to, we have some catching up to do.
457600	460980	But it should not be driven by partisanship.
461200	464140	So please think of a question or a statement.
464280	468380	I'd like to hear your thoughts on the bringing in of the BC Energy Regulator
468380	471740	and some of the other industry conditions and constraints.
472060	474860	And I'll go ahead and take one question first.
475320	476100	Okay, sounds good.
476100	481940	I did have five questions prepared, but Amelie Valeria was really eager to hear from the room,
482120	485560	so I'll ask my one, and then we'll open it up to the floor.
485680	486640	So thank you so much, Jeremy.
486900	490360	There's obviously a lot of thought going into the Greens approach,
490580	494320	and I know that everyone in the room is eager to connect that vision
494320	497200	to the work that we're doing in the clean energy sector,
497380	500260	so especially when it comes to delivering projects on the ground.
500260	503520	So my one question before we turn to the floor.
504280	510980	Your election 2024, most recently, last fall,
512320	516460	rightly identified the election platform document that your party put out,
517180	519900	rightly identified the need for long-term procurement targets
519900	521640	and workforce development.
522180	525260	As someone trying to plan and finance these projects,
525960	527960	I say predictability is everything.
527960	532540	So what would a stable, investor-friendly, clean energy plan look like
532540	534600	from a BC Green perspective,
534820	539920	one that delivers both on climate outcomes and economic certainty?
539980	543680	I know you touched on it a little bit, but let us know.
543800	544460	What's your plan?
545140	548120	Yeah, I mean, I think we all know that predictability is key,
548300	551740	and it's, like I've said, lurching between calls for power every 15 years
551740	554020	doesn't work.
554020	559960	I think, you know, the key piece for us is, like I said,
560020	563760	government needs to articulate a vision and how we're going to get there.
564220	567360	I think, you know, like any enterprise, there should be,
567580	570400	you know, there needs to be targets that we actually make.
570660	573600	The climate targets are excessively frustrating
573600	576320	because there's really no consequences to not meeting them,
576320	579360	and that's really not the way that we should be.
579480	581420	They need to be linked to some kind of consequences.
582220	586060	We're extremely keen on supporting technological innovation,
586340	589560	so, you know, the fact that geothermal and battery storage
589560	592660	is included in this call is really, really important,
592660	597020	and all the other innovation that's taking place.
597400	600200	We've just heard a whole lot about solar and energy,
600360	601500	community energy co-ops.
602600	605780	We do have a paradigm shift to make in this province.
606040	607740	It's not all resource extraction.
608400	612240	We can be a clean Canada, can be an energy superpower.
612820	614880	We need to look at domestic use,
615280	618120	and then the certainty that comes with funding and training
618120	621620	and job creation, we'll hear about skilled trades,
621760	625860	so we need to set the foundation for this now.
626100	629300	I mean, well, we needed to be setting it five to ten years ago,
629380	631400	and that's where we need to say,
631580	632460	we know where we're going.
633040	635840	BC Hydro might be building a big hydro-powered dam,
635880	637440	but we know we're going to need more energy,
637580	640760	and so this, you know, we saw the curves
640760	643300	versus the IEA projections on solar,
643300	647820	and I think we need to be bullish about planning for this for the future,
647820	648640	and be bold.
651620	652980	Any questions from the floor,
653100	654940	or should I go to the rest of the questions?
657860	659600	Well, it's a good thing I prepped five.
660780	662500	Thanks for sticking with us to the end of the day.
663800	665980	So you touched on it a little bit,
666080	668160	but let's expand on it a little bit further.
668300	671480	Given today's geopolitical and economic uncertainties,
671480	674580	energy security is coming up more and more.
675220	677180	How do the Greens view energy sovereignty,
677180	679740	and what role should renewable energy play
679740	681980	in strengthening BC's self-sufficiency?
683840	688100	Yeah, I mean, energy security, energy sovereignty,
688100	690420	and sovereignty is clearly important,
690420	695640	and, you know, in the discussions about an east-west energy grid,
696260	699740	I think, you know, and this crisis does create an opportunity
699740	701980	for us to find those,
702180	704580	and, you know, part of Bill 7
704580	707260	is about decreasing inter-provincial trade barriers.
707780	709560	I guess I just want to draw the distinction
709560	711920	between energy sovereignty and home,
712040	715500	and the supply of energy that we need here
715500	718520	versus massive exports of gas,
718700	720220	of the provide gas.
720220	724360	So to the Greens, that's a climate disaster,
724360	727960	and it's not necessarily part of our energy sovereignty.
728460	730000	We'd like to live within our borders,
730660	733560	you know, use the resources that we have here
733560	736640	to strengthen that sovereignty
736640	739300	and move forward with that.
739680	742140	It's not necessarily about export.
742140	745880	And I think, you know, the transition is key
745880	748600	to where we land in this.
748820	751080	If the U.S. is going to back away from renewables,
751200	752920	then maybe that's an opportunity for us.
753060	755420	I know you're not all seeing that on the ground yet,
755620	757740	but that's what we would hope to, you know,
757800	759520	create those conditions that allow that to happen.
760820	761620	Okay, thank you.
762560	766780	I see that we've got one question that's come in.
767040	768420	So the question is,
768420	770640	what specifically do the B.C. Greens want to change
770640	771520	with Bill 14?
771960	774060	Is there a balance between regulatory efficiency
774060	775240	and environmental protections?
776180	776660	Yeah, thanks.
776760	778040	That's a great question.
778340	780800	It's trying to achieve that balance.
782160	784620	And Bill 14 is, I'll say,
784700	786840	less challenging for us than Bill 15
786840	789100	because Bill 15 is just a blanket cabinet
789100	791100	that determines what's a significant project
791100	792160	and it goes ahead.
792420	796060	It could be a very streamlined environmental assessment process
796060	797660	that is essentially what cabinets,
797660	798660	cabinet decides.
799420	801940	Bill 14 is, you know,
801980	802900	it's about renewable energy,
803060	805500	so we are trying to be supportive.
805640	807720	We're trying to work our ways through it.
807940	809840	But the changes that we want
809840	811940	are really about transparency and oversight.
814080	814620	If, you know,
814700	817060	if B.C. Energy regulator is going to regulate these,
817120	817500	that's great.
817600	819140	They're currently not as transparent
819140	820940	as, say, the Environmental Assessment Office,
821060	822220	but also the cabinet decisions
822220	823720	that are going to set that process
823720	826380	need to be transparent
826380	827620	and they need to be accountable.
828140	828720	It's, you know,
828720	829320	with Bill 7,
829420	830360	we agreed that we would
830360	833920	have a legislative committee of all parties
833920	835000	to make it nonpartisan,
835200	836440	have a look at the regulations
836440	838900	after they're established.
839180	840500	And at least that gives the opportunity
840500	843060	to point out what's not working,
843300	844700	find the unintended consequences
844700	846940	and maybe change course.
847260	849380	If it's all done behind closed doors
849380	849800	of the cabinet,
849960	852720	then that's not going to work.
852860	853100	It's not,
853220	855160	that's going to build more mistrust
855160	855560	in government
855560	856920	and it's going to create more of a backlash,
857040	859200	which I don't want any of you to see
859200	860200	because I think these projects
860200	861180	are really important.
861380	866420	So the balance is more about transparency
866420	868260	and oversight of making sure
868260	869040	that these processes
869040	870200	don't get short-circuited
870200	872100	and to the detriment
872100	873700	of really all of us.
874700	875480	Okay, thank you.
876140	877960	I think we've got time
877960	880300	for just one last quick follow-up question.
880480	881720	It's actually a question
881720	882460	that I put together
882460	884300	and I feel like it goes hand-in-hand
884300	885900	with the one that was just asked.
886460	887540	Specifically around,
888080	889480	I feel like your party
889480	890520	has been a little bit critical.
890720	891980	I watch for the question period
891980	893660	and I've seen some of the remarks
893660	894840	or heard some of the remarks
894840	896940	with regard to the most recent procurement,
897940	899280	pricing, so on and so forth,
899280	900400	and obviously permitting reform.
900860	901980	As someone working directly
901980	903980	in the industry and sector,
904120	904840	I'm curious,
905380	906600	who are you consulting with
906600	908040	to form these positions?
908200	909740	Are you talking to developers,
910660	912080	Indigenous nations as partners,
912800	914940	local communities as part of that dialogue
914940	916620	or does it mostly happen
916620	918900	within the policy and advocacy sphere
918900	919600	and circles?
920440	921660	Yeah, great question.
921940	924160	Victoria can be a bit of a bubble
924160	925360	and that's, you know,
925820	927920	I've spent a lot of time there
927920	928620	in the last few months
928620	929300	and I'm looking forward
929300	930280	to getting back to,
931160	932520	back to, you know,
932560	933760	get grounded in the sea and sky
933760	934960	and the rest of the province.
935240	935800	So there is,
935940	937240	there is some, you know,
937280	938760	policy pieces
938760	939840	that is a bit disconnected
939840	940300	in Victoria.
941380	942680	I've heard from some developers
942680	944340	and I'm here to, you know,
944800	945860	put my name out there
945860	946940	and hear from more.
947100	948240	I would say we take most
948240	948840	of our guidance
948840	950060	at this time
950060	951500	from First Nations.
951500	952200	So for example,
952360	954140	Union of BC and Indian Chiefs
954140	955060	has come out strongly
955060	956180	on Bill 15
956180	957560	and we believe
957560	958040	that they have,
958260	959920	they really have a strong argument
959920	960740	to make about
960740	962380	the free prior
962380	963120	and informed consent
963120	964500	and participation.
965440	966380	Same with First Nations
966380	967100	Leadership Council
967100	968960	and then when it comes
968960	969480	to some of these
969480	970920	local governments
970920	972240	are also, you know,
972280	972960	throwing up caution.
973100	974200	Not so much
974200	975140	about the renewable energy
975140	976000	Bill 14
976000	977380	but about Bill 15
977380	978680	and the infrastructure
978680	980160	projects in general
980160	981560	kind of steamrolling
981560	982300	little governments
982300	984660	has been done
984660	985180	in the past
985180	986060	and I would argue
986060	987720	it's not good
987720	990180	for the overall process.
990320	990600	I don't think
990600	991280	it's good for business.
991440	992020	I don't think
992020	992920	it's good for,
993020	993220	you know,
993260	993820	public trust
993820	995020	and institutions.
995460	998860	So, yeah,
999020	1001140	the people
1001140	1001820	that we're listening
1001820	1003140	to are, you know,
1003160	1003760	to some degree
1003760	1005060	you're kind of
1005060	1006940	typical green advisors
1006940	1007460	but we,
1007760	1008440	my job,
1008940	1009120	you know,
1009320	1010300	I got into this
1010300	1011200	because I thought
1011200	1011940	we needed more people
1011940	1013180	with a technical background,
1013340	1013740	more engineers
1013740	1014260	and scientists
1014260	1014880	and politics
1014880	1015280	and so
1015280	1017240	I don't listen
1017240	1018000	to anybody
1018000	1019120	and if there's
1019120	1019540	proponents
1019540	1020060	that have,
1020240	1020460	you know,
1020500	1021340	really strong opinions
1021340	1021880	about how this
1021880	1022300	should be done
1022300	1023120	I would love
1023120	1024160	to hear from you
1024160	1025940	and I've got some cards
1025940	1027780	and you can find me
1027780	1028580	online
1028580	1029720	but it is really
1029720	1030420	important to hear
1030420	1031580	the people doing it
1031580	1031920	on the ground
1031920	1032480	there are people
1032480	1032800	who are sitting
1032800	1033220	in offices
1033220	1034020	as we all know
1034020	1035220	who haven't done
1035220	1036020	this work
1036020	1037200	and they need
1037200	1037800	to hear from you
1037800	1039060	and sometimes
1039060	1039860	that can be
1039860	1041240	really difficult
1041240	1042620	to get that message
1042620	1042860	through
1042860	1045460	so I'm open
1045460	1047980	to hearing more
1047980	1049380	and I think
1049380	1050380	that's kind of key
1050380	1051040	that's what government
1051040	1051720	needs to do too
1051720	1052200	and sometimes
1052200	1052800	we get on this
1052800	1054040	ideological track
1054040	1055100	and we get tunnel
1055100	1055620	vision on what
1055620	1056100	we should do
1056100	1056820	and we're just
1056820	1057260	trying to make sure
1057260	1057800	that doesn't happen.
1058880	1059820	Thank you very much.
1060300	1061800	So, I'm afraid
1061800	1062320	that that's all
1062320	1062620	the time
1062620	1063260	that we have.
1063440	1064080	Jeremy, thank you
1064080	1064520	so much
1064520	1065100	for being here today.
1065100	1065940	we appreciate it.
1065940	1065980	Thank you.
1065980	1066880	Thank you.
1066880	1066940	Thank you.
1066940	1067020	Thank you.
1067020	1067100	Thank you.
