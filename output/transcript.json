{"text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 2024 called the power blend, what the outlet looks like for those projects now is even into the important part of implementation and execution to get those electrons into the grid. Great, thanks, Heli. It's great to be here on my last grade with the swabish doing territory again this year. And I'm really pleased with how the 24 call in my position to see all probably more than 10 effects just before Christmas. That's direct presentation from across the province. We have pretty good prices, which were really important for our work for the people to enforce. We had tremendous participation and involvement for first patients. So we are moving into a thinking called the hard part, which is getting the project's goals and across the line and we are going to process with our utility commission if those contracts accepted and that is underway. We are working intensely on the connections on our side to make sure we are ready to take away the power and generally working the individual developers and first patients to ensure that the public scale on other other practices. Now we're living in an interesting time right now in the external ecosystem that we're trying to do these Monte-year projects in its volatile to be an understanding. So any questions on the C-Puygos perspective around tariffs and the trade instability and how that risk can be managed by both? I mean it is a very challenging time and that is one of the reasons we accelerated those times the 22-5 power. Kim Gilsdinger acknowledged that folks and and I really recognize the positive role that our renewable energy plays supporting our economy. It's really critical time. And we want to work with the sector and developers to ensure the incentives and the process. We're going to have a short consultation process this time, largely for looking at heating, for the most part of our program. We're going to have a short consultation process this time largely for looking at the most of our public, what worked well at the previous calls. So if there are concerns of the tariff impacts on the cost of goods. We want to hear that. We have to. We have a few, so we will take you up on that. So you started to lead into the 2025 call, so big announcement last week. Do want to tell us a little bit more about what you're looking for? Sure. So we made this announcement last week. Do you want to tell us a little bit more? Sure. Sure. So we made this announcement last day with the energy minister. We announced it's part of the five point plan actually, so that the call for power is a part of that where we want to do again what we did last time so successfully. But varied with a few changes, for example, we are working probably for the rule power for participation along the same lines. power for patients, participation, while we say, the one of the same lines. We want the process accelerated so that we're going to issue the call in the procurement documents in the summer. We would like to report contracts early in the instance. And one of the changes we are when we have capacity limits, and we got back and that was construing the purpose of projects, and the new of the Hall River that's the building on the House of last the road routes to go.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 3.76], "text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 2024"}, {"timestamp": [3.76, 8.16], "text": " called the power blend, what the outlet looks like for those projects now"}, {"timestamp": [8.16, 12.6], "text": " is even into the important part of implementation and execution to get those"}, {"timestamp": [12.6, 13.6], "text": " electrons into the grid."}, {"timestamp": [13.6, 17.0], "text": " Great, thanks, Heli.
