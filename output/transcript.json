{"text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 2024 called the power plant, what the outlet looks like for those projects now so we've moved into the important part of implementation and execution to get those electrons into the grid. Great, thanks, Heli. It's great to be here on my last grade. This year and I'm really pleased with how the 24 call in the United States you all come really more than 10 effects just before Christmas. That's representation from across the province. We have pretty good prices, which were really important for our local ability goals. And of course, we had tremendous participation and involvement for first patients. So we are moving into a thinking called the hard part, which is getting the project's goals and across the line and we are going to process with our Utility Commission and those contracts accepted and that is the way we are working intensely on the connections on our side to make sure we are ready to take away the power. And generally, working the English with developers and first patients to ensure that the privacy get off other directions. We're living in a bit of an interesting time right now in the external ecosystem that we're trying to do these Monteier projects in this volatile to be an understanding. So any questions on the C.Puygos perspective around tariffs and the trade instability and how that risk can be managed by both. I mean it is a very challenging time and that is one of the reasons we accelerated those plans in the 22-5 all power. Kim Bill Sitter acknowledged that folks paid in the end of the day of really energy plays supporting our economy. It's really critical time. I mean, a lot of work with the sector and developers to ensure the incentives were updated in the process. We're going to have a short consultation process this time, largely for the most part of our work well. We're going to have a short consultation process this time largely because we're looking at for the most of our public, what worked well in the previous calls. So if there are concerns of the tariff impacts on the cost of goods, we want to hear that. The idea that they have to be in the actual. terrible impacts on the on the ideas that they have been natural. So I'm sure we have a few, so we will take you up on that. So you started to lead into the 2025 call, so big announcement last week. Do you want to tell us what you're looking for? Sure. So we made this announcement last Monday with the Premier, the Energy Minister. We announced it's part of the Five-Point Plan actually, so the call for Power Committee would be part of that where we want to do again what we did last time so successfully. Would vary with a few changes, for example, we are working probably for removal power. We're looking for for patients, participation, along the same lines. say, the process accelerated. We want the process accelerated, so we're going to issue the column in the procurement documents in the summer, and we would like to report contracts early in 2026. And one of the changes we are when we're doing about capacity limits. So we got feedback that was constraining in the public projects and we will see what possible in several projects. So the main site of the opportunity and the building of the hall paper that's working on the last paper to go and work on the project.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 4.32], "text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 2024"}, {"timestamp": [4.32, 8.16], "text": " called the power plant, what the outlet looks like for those projects now"}, {"timestamp": [8.16, 12.24], "text": " so we've moved into the important part of implementation and execution"}, {"timestamp": [12.24, 14.0], "text": " to get those electrons into the grid."}, {"timestamp": [14.0, 15.44], "text": " Great, thanks, Heli."}, {"timestamp": [15.44, 17.0], "text": " It's great to be here on my last grade."}, {"timestamp": [17.0, 23.6], "text": " This year and I'm really pleased with how the"}, {"timestamp": [23.6, 27.56], "text": " 24 call in the United States you all come really more than 10 effects"}, {"timestamp": [27.56, 36.0], "text": " just before Christmas.
