{"text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 24 Health Power Fund, what the outlet looks like for those projects now as we move into the important part of implementation and execution to get those electrons into the grid. Great, thanks. It's great to be here on my last grade. This year and I'm really pleased with a 2024 call for questions as you all will be awarded 10 effects just before Christmas. The next representation from across the province, we have pretty good prices, which were really important for our work for ability goals and of course we had tremendous participation and involvement for patients. So we are moving into a thank you all part part, which is getting the projects of the world and across the first nations. So we are moving into, I think we call the hard part, which is getting the project's goals and across the line. And we are going to process with our utility commission to get those contracts accepted. And that is the way we are working intensely on the connections on our side, to make sure we are ready to take away the power. And generally, That's other way, we are working intensely on the connections on our side to make sure we're ready to take away the power. And generally generally working the English with developers and first patients to ensure that they're off on other other practices. Now we're living in a bit of an interesting time right now in the external ecosystem that we're trying to do these multi-year projects in this volatile to be an understanding. So any other questions on we see private's perspective around tariffs and the trade instability and how that risk can be this volatile to be an understanding. So any of the questions on we see Hyguable around tariffs and the trade instability and how that risk can be that managed by both. I mean, it is a very challenging time, and I think that is one of the reasons we accelerated those plans in the 20-25 of all the power. Can't consider I acknowledge that the money, but we really recognize a massive role that renewable energy plays, supporting our community, it is really critical time. We want to work with the sector and developers to ensure the entities, we're going to have a short consultation process this time, largely for looking for heating, for the most of our public. to ensure that you're being the city's protected in the process. We're going to have a short consultation process this time largely for for the most of our public, what works well. We're going to have a short consultation process this time largely because we're looking at heating for the most of our public, what worked well at the previous calls. So if there are concerns of the tariff impacts on the cost of goods, we want to manage that. Oh, I'm sure we have a few, so we will take you up on that. So you started to lead into the 2025 call, so big announcement last week. Do you want to tell us a little bit more of what you're looking for? Sure. So we made this announcement last Monday with the Premier, the Energy Minister, we announced it's part of the 5-point plan actually, so that the call for powers would be part of that where we want to do again what we did last time so successfully. We varied with a few changes, for example, we are working probably for the rural power. We're looking for first patients, participation on the same lines. You want the process accelerated so that we're going to issue the call in the procurement documents in the summer, and we would like to report contracts early in 2026. And one of the changes we are when we read about capacity limits. So we got feedback and that was constraining in our projects. And it would be possible and separate rubber signs. So the main site in about the opportunity and the building of the hall paper that's the rule of the project.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 6.72], "text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 24 Health Power Fund, what the"}, {"timestamp": [6.72, 11.04], "text": " outlet looks like for those projects now as we move into the important part of implementation"}, {"timestamp": [11.04, 14.04], "text": " and execution to get those electrons into the grid."}, {"timestamp": [14.04, 15.04], "text": " Great, thanks."}, {"timestamp": [15.04, 17.04], "text": " It's great to be here on my last grade."}, {"timestamp": [17.04, 25.84], "text": " This year and I'm really pleased with a 2024 call for questions as you all"}, {"timestamp": [25.84, 29.84], "text": " will be awarded 10 effects just before Christmas."}, {"timestamp": [29.84, 41.08], "text": " The next representation from across the province, we have pretty good prices, which were really important for our work for ability goals and of course we had tremendous participation and involvement"}, {"timestamp": [41.08, 42.08], "text": " for patients."}, {"timestamp": [42.08, 47.28], "text": " So we are moving into a thank you all part part, which is getting the projects"}, {"timestamp": [47.28, 45.0], "text": " of the world and across the first nations.
