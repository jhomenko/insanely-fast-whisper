Great, thanks, Heli. It's great to be here on my last grade. This year, and I'm really pleased with how the 2024 call I should see all come awarded 10 effects just before Christmas.. That's representation from across the products. We have pretty good prices, which were really important for our local ability goals and in the course we had tremendous participation and involvement for our patients. So we are moving into a think we call the hard part, which is getting the project's and we are going to process with our utility commission if those contracts accepted and that is the way we are working intensely on the connections on our side to make sure we are ready to take away the power and generally working with the individual developers and first patients to ensure that how to get off a better direction. We're looking at a bit of a new time right now and the external ecosystem. an external ecosystem that we're all trying to do these Monte-year projects in this volatile to be an understanding. So any questions on we see Hyres perspective around tariffs and the trade instability and how that risk can be this managed by both. I mean it is a very challenging time and I think that is one of the reasons we accelerated those plans in the 22-5 power. Can the bill sooner acknowledge that it works in the way of really recognize the passive role that renewable energy play supporting our economy that is really critical time. We want to work with the sector and developers to ensure the entities we're going to have a short consultation process this time largely for the meeting. For meeting. for the most part of the work well of the news calls so if there are their service of the tariff and tax line on the cost of goods we want to hear that and the ideas that they have not been matched. I'm sure we have a few so we will take you up on that. So you started to lead into the 2025 calls so big announcement last week. Monday the premier of the energy minister we announced it's part of the five-point plan actually so that the call for power is a really part of that where we want to do again what we did last time so successfully with a few changes for example we are working probably the rule power the process accelerated so we're going to issue the call in the procurement documents in the summer and we would like to report contracts early in 2026. And one of the changes we are, we're moving about capacity limits. So we've got feedback that was concerning the first projects and we will see what possible little sector. So the main site is in the opportunity and community is going to be the whole framework. So we're going to the whole group of the city and all the whole market. That's the last time."}], "chunks": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 223.401375, "text": " Talk a little bit on these matters perspective on now the 2024 called the Power Fund, what the outlet looks like for those projects now is moving into the important part of implementation and execution to get those electrons into the grid.
