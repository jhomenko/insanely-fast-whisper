{"speakers": [{"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "start": 0.0, "end": 3476.245375, "text": " start to finish, so we're not going to be able to real-time runs with specific questions, but discussion on sort of what are the priorities, how we might do that, and happy to connect with how we can collaborate with folks moving forward on specific questions or have a discussion about things like that. So as I said, I'll just present for maybe 15, 20 minutes and then we can open it up to a broad discussion. Before I start, I want to acknowledge that I live in work and play on the indigenous land of the Neuokunum's Kalish-speaking people. This Lecholicht Lakeland, which is Furnaby Mountain, and my home is located near this forest, so I love being able to go and do walks in the forest. And then I'm also very privileged to be able to take a sailboat off the Saina Kaiyam, which is an Indian arm, and a cow town and around the other sea here. I really appreciate, I was imported by my parents when I was really young, and I really appreciate being a living work on these these lands and hopefully some of the modeling work making good decisions around energy helps move things forward with reconciliation because really we want to make sure we have a good future world for everyone involved and reconciliation is a good part of that, making sure that we address those challenges that continue to exist because of colonialization. And so hopefully the work we present here and our work going forward is part of that addressing those challenges. I'm happy to talk with anyone about my personality and things like that. I can like at any point feel free to come in a challenge to be about that. So quick outline of what I'm going to present to first and then at the end here it's going to be all about you having a discussion with us. So I'll quickly talk about the research group, the two members here, the bigger research group, what we do, what we're focused on, why we exist. Then the specific modeling, the, I do a lot of modeling and this is specifically about the BC model that Elias and Jocelyn and others have worked on over the last I guess three years. In the program it said I think picks so Pacific Institute, so I have to acknowledge that they funded a lot of the work building this model. We have an opportunity grant from them over the course of three years, and that grant was just finished off. Well, that microphone, hopefully people don't need me to use the microphone, but if you can't hear me, you do the, you know, it's not that big of a room, it feels like it's unnecessary. So yeah, so the modeling was part of my fix project. That project is now finished off, but the model is now ready for us to work with people in industry, government, everything like that. Really excited to be able to present what we can do with the model and really talk about there. There's some capabilities that we're building the model. Maybe there's specific questions you have that aren't there yet, but we can add in and answer those different questions about where we go in the province. And then having that. So here's the team. Here's me, with less hair than I used that I have now. These are the people who do all the really good work and Abby and I up here at the top get to take credit for a lot of that so I really do want to acknowledge that I lead this group of people to do really good work. I don't do a lot of the specific work at this point, but I lead the team. And so really acknowledge Elias, Jocelyn, a few other team members who aren't on this slide anymore that have left the team now that help with building the different pieces of the modeling. And so really, it's an amazing pleasure to be able to be up here and showcase their work and acknowledge that it is their work. Our group really is about sort of sustainable energy engineering and modeling to develop better results. So looking at how we support effective decision making, how we look at different policies, interactions with the, a lot of our modeling is climate land, energy, and water interactions, how the different systems interact. So part of the model that we have representing here is actually a nexus model for BC, which includes larynx water and energy. I don't think we have any results from that specific interaction at this point, but that interaction is really important. I also do work internationally helping other countries look at their climate land energy and water systems. And so really looking at how those different pieces interact, because climate impacts the water system, water and energy are very interconnected, especially in a place like BC where we have hydro, so those water pieces are in there, and then land where you have food production, you usually need water, resources, and things like that. And really looking at data-driven energy system development, and a large focus on open source modeling so that it's transparent so other people can pick up the analysis and then sort of interrogate what we've done and say well did you think about those pieces you can look at those different pieces and see how that all fits together. So British Columbia, you all know this. I assume you all know this. Is everyone from British Columbia? Anyone not from BC? Oh, it's actually quite a good group. So that's interesting. That's great. So if you're not from BC and you don't know about our province, you know at least a little bit because you're here, so you know that we're down here in Vancouver. It's a very big province. Different regions have different energy resources, different demands. We have a big load center here in Vancouver for electricity demand because that's where most of the population is. There's a smaller load center in Victoria and some of the other cities. And then if you listen to Chris O'Reilly earlier, BC Hydro was looking at sending a lineup into this northwest area, northwest, yes that's the one, to connect some of the loads that are up there, because right now there's not a lot of BC Hydro service load up there, there's some remote communities with diesel and things like that and there's some loads expected out in that area as well. Currently our installed Komasty Mix is really big hydro, is the big chunk of things. We've got some small hydro run the river and then a few other little pieces But basically most of our province runs on hydro at this point, which is really great. But as the population increases, as we increase demands, the question is, where is the next set of information, or set of generations come from? Are we going to dam other rivers? Are we going to build nuclear? Are we in a mid-solar? Are we going to do wind? Where does that come from? How does that work? And then also looking at the operation, not just the, not just looking at the sort of capacity that we need, but we need the capacity in terms of the generation capacity, but we also need the electrons to be available when we want them. So it's not just capacity, but it's also the timing of that capacity and when we need those electrons. And so based on Canadian net zero futures reported in 2023, demand is going up for electricity. And so that's something probably everyone here is generally aware of with EBS, heat pumps and things like that. People installing more air conditioners as it gets hotter during the summers and we've got this expanding demand and so how do we address that demand? What is the best structures to actually address that demand? So part of that is the power 24 last year where we got 1500 megawatts of wind and 100 megawatts across the province. We've let the call for power 2025 coming out or don't know exactly where the document was right now. I think Chris Riley said they're coming to the sort of call specifics are coming out very soon and so looking at adding more generation one of the interesting things where this generation tends to end up is it's not down here where the load center is. And so one of the pieces of the puzzle is also is not just what generation do we want to add to the system, but how are we going to get that generation where people actually need to use it, which is down in the road sector here. Seems to be a fly that's flying around. Distracting things flying around. But that's okay. So and then also connections to our friends in Alberta and our friends down south. Friends, questionable at this point down south, we're not sure about that one. But those connections are also very important for reliability and most in terms of the province's reliability, but also our ability to help our colleagues and friends in other places and their reliability in the air. So resource options, what do we have available in the province to actually create more energy? So if we know our demand is going up, where are we getting that from? The general discussion is about these four different items. Some people talk about natural gas still as being an option. Personally I think if we're going to address climate change I think natural gas needs to be phased out. Maybe keep the ones that we have running for the time being, but it should be phased out. So there's really the zero carbon option. There's a hydro, runner river or large hydro, depending on what the river looks like. We've got solar, we've got wind, and the potential for nuclear. Chris O'Reilly, I think also mentioned nuclear. Or no, it was the premier mentioned nuclear and saying that we've got lots of petroleum electricity, so we maybe shouldn't look at nuclear. I think that's fine from a political standpoint as an academic. I want to look at all the options and so keep those in there including natural gas potentially with CCS or cold with CCS if we can get CCS that actually works effectively so far the demonstrations out there with CCS haven't really demonstrated that it's going to be cost effective or carbon effective in terms of how it actually captures things. But then those are potential possibilities. So what's the CCS? A carbon capture and sometimes CCS, so carbon capture and then storage and or sequestration or so basically capturing the carbon that comes up the end and sticking out the ground. Problem with that even on the best plant you're getting 70% capture so you're still emitting 30% which that doesn't seem like that zero would be that's probably not going to work but different technologies for how we use these different resources all do need to be investigated so that's sort of the research group and and the concept that we're going and now I'll talk a little bit about the model itself and what the model is capable of doing and then an example of the law. So Pinks funded this BC combined modeling study really to look at the BC's climate goals, strategic investment, and energy reliability. So those sort of three broad scope questions. And the way we're addressing that is with three different modeling tools. One is a nexus model, which is an energy capacity expansion model, which also looks at the water and land system at different levels of complexity. But that's a very big picture capacity expansion model looking at the whole province on long time scales. But because of that, we can't do hourly detailed studies within that. And so that's why we also built a Pykes-A model looking at the operational system of the power system. So how does the power system actually operate if we have, if we build a big nuclear plant, what does that do within the power system? How does that work? How does the system operate with that plant install? And then we built some tools at Chalius, spent a lot of his time building this linking tool, which allows us to take a capacity expansion. Across the expansion says we need 2 gigawatts of wind. Where does that wind go in the province? How do we decide where it goes? What is the best, the appropriate sort of cycle of when the wind generates? How does that connect into the other pieces? And then we put that into the power system model, which then can look at both the operation, when does the wind blow, when do we we get the electrons from that when does the hydro have to back that up do we have enough generation all the way and then also is the transmission system people dealing with where things are at so where does the transmission system need some extra investments? And so more details are a flow of data, results from the nexus model, then go into pipes the model, and we have some feedback there piecing things together. So we've got one raw data building this whole structure and that whole structure runs in an automated workflow and then we get to the remote-out which we then can take some analysis work. So moving forward how do we actually address this model? And how do we use these models for policy analysis? And so general concept is we have some policy structure, some baseline starting out. And then we might look at that policy and say, well's the scenario related that so the policy might be that we want to do nuclear in the province maybe that'll never happen in this province but maybe that's policy that comes up you never know happens with governments, they do sometimes change their minds randomly. So if we put that scenario, we say, okay, the province is going to allow nuclear. So now the model inputs would be, what is that look like in the model, and that's releasing the model to allow it to decide if it wants to invest a nuclear or not. Then we get some model results to see how much nuclear gets invested in or not depending on what the different case is. We interpret that and say, okay, well, if we allow nuclear in the province, here's what the system looks like, here's what it does, and then we can provide some policy recommendation. Maybe we say it's not necessary to do nuclear, or maybe the model says it actually makes a lot of sense to do that. So just to show you what the results look like, this happens to be a nuclear example because we have to run one, but just to show you what the results look like so that when we get into discussion we can talk about what are, given that type of result, what are you interested in seeing? So yeah, so different possibilities of scenarios so we can look at what happens when we have a lot of renewables, immigration, nuclear expansion, we can look at different technological investments, storage, carbon, and storage. We can look at different technological investments, storage, high carbon capture and storage. We can look at policy and regulation. So if we have an energy efficiency regulation, what does that do to our demand protection, carbon pricing, and looking at potentially trade with different regions within Canada or into the US. If the federal government decides to build a big transmission line across the country, how does that change our VC modeling situation? And so, yeah, in the scenario formulation, we then turn it into specific details of what actually goes into the model. So we might, if we allow the clearer, we might pull a range of cost for nuclear, we might allow transmission expansion or not, depending on what we're trying to do there, and then the resource options for different pieces. So one of the pieces of the whole puzzle, and Elie spent a lot of time with this as well, is looking at where in the province these different pieces go. So what are the land use constraints on the actual model? Where are we allowed to build things? Where can't we build things? I think this is a sort of apology. So these big gray areas are probably places we don't want to build wind turbines because you're building them on very steep edges and it's not there might be a lot of wind up there but a really steep edge isn't going to be great for building your wind turbine and then different land covers different generation like capacity factors, all that information gets put together to sort of give us a deep map of where land is available to be able to install things like wind turbine. I think this is wind. This is mostly wind to here, yeah. So these are buffer zones for airplane landing areas. These are protected conservation areas. There's proximity to the grid infrastructure. All gets put together and says, okay, here's where we might want to put wind in the model, in the pipe sub model, the nexus model is looking at the whole province at once. And then sort of looking at investments to be made, we can then rank these investments. So there's a sort of ranking piece there. So the red here on this graph is really not a good rank. You don't want to put them in on these red spots. The blue spots are where we want the lower rank. It's a golf score. Lower is better. And so these lower spots, we know that there's good wind up here in the peace region, so and a little bit on the high island maybe here near back in the land. Can loop. That's can loop, see it? And then solar, the lighter color is better. And so there's quite a bit of solar in the province. I don't think this one entirely takes into account the mountainous regions, because I think that's the big map has quite a bit of solar. But basically giving you the sort of ranking so that we can decide how we're going to choose these different technologies. And then the results we get. So in this case, this was a low demand growth scenario with nuclear involved and we invested quite a bit of nuclear at sort of the, and then we varied the cost on this one. And so the standard here is the cost that some industry, I think it might be, is it Enrail that we get the standard baseline cost from? So Enrail puts out the standard baseline costs and we say, okay, well if Enrail is correct, here's what nuclear we would install and then nuclear is often more expensive when you actually build it because of regulatory issues and challenges and so we looked at two times and four times and you can see that standard prices from N-rail simply installed quite a lot of nuclear and then it drops quite a bit when the costs go up. So I just realize the... The gray one is nuclear. Oh, we don't install the right. The blue is, the blue is when, we install it like, switch up to win and then we install a nuclear until it gets expensive. So the nuclear gets installed in 2045 and then disappears afterwards. Sorry, I was looking at the wrong color. The blue is the wind and orange is solar. So the wind and solar is still installed at the same amounts, except for here we install less if we have nuclear available in 2486. We also give the model a long timeline to look at nuclear because it's not going to be built tomorrow. We can probably build a wind turbine or two tomorrow, but even then there's a limitation on how much we can build build up in a given year. But nuclear isn't going to happen tomorrow, so there is a little bit of timeline in the model that it requires. But it doesn't build it until quite much the same information on that one. So operation, we can see where what's happened. So this is now the pipe sum model. So the first one is do we install the law, the nuclear, and then this one is where the operation happened. Blue here is hydro, which does a lot of our problems and then we've got some river, some wind, some solar and some nuclear in there. If you plotted this the other way around the nuclear would be pretty flat, it would basically be base load power that it's running. And then with the, in this case, hydro is farming the renewables and really doing that variability. And then we also have this area here, which is actually a backstop, which the model is saying there's places where I cannot get this energy. So the big capacity expansion model says, we have enough energy to run the province, but the operational model says we're not getting. I think someone's re-mounted in the back of it. So it's all good. And then the question we need to dig into there is, why is that, why are parts of the province not being served properly? And it turns out that there's enough energy available in the system with the capacity that we've expanded, but there's actually a transmission line limitation to certain areas of the province. And that actually, well that's the same information we have before. There's a little bit more details on what happens if the costs go up, you get less nuclear. But here's the example of what happens. We have no nuclear. There's some grid congestion. And then you can see here there's significant grid concession out to the island. And so when we actually run the model with that grid congestion, we can say, okay, there's significant grid congestion here on the island, here in the south of the province, and here in the eastern point in the province, there's some significant grid connection issues and so the unserved load that backstop is actually grid connection challenges that we can actually model with the tools so we can look at those grid connection challenges where and how do we need to expand the grid to actually address that? And Chris O'Reilly did talk a little bit about that, about having to expand the grid to meet demands. And this happens to be for 2048. And we're not, in this case, we haven't allowed the grid to expand. Obviously, when you do allowed the grid to expand, it is going to meet those different pieces and then your your unserved load drops drastically as you're allowed to move those electrons around but one of the things to realize is that most of our renewable energy is not in this load center down here and so that grid expansion is going to be really important to make sure that we can piece all those pieces together and get the energy where customers like us when we want the lights on unless we turn them off of the back suddenly we want to keep that ready. And you're talking about true expansion versus bottlenecks are you talking about physical expansion versus where we have no capacity because it's already fully loaded this is this is these are the gridlides that are currently fully loaded so the that could be re-conducturing if there's space to build more. Maybe you can add more conductors or re-conductor. But that basically that line is fully loaded so we can't add more. So it is also possible to say, well, maybe a line from here to here to add that in there. We look at those different scenarios if there is a pathway to build a line in a different place our province does unfortunately have lots of mountains. Fortunately because they're beautiful places to go but yeah so there's no challenges to challenges to figure out where to run those lines. And those are definitely scenarios we'd be happy to look at as well. It's okay. What if we propose to build a line from here to here, what does that look like? So that was sort of an overview of some of the results we can get from the model and now the idea is to bring it into a discussion. I'd love to talk with you about what you see and sort of have three discussion questions. What specific scenarios would you be interested in with that type of model that we had? What we do want to see actually run with that? Questions about model capabilities if you want to go into that area or and how can Delta plus fabric to answer your questions? And lots of different ways we can do that depending on where things are up. So I will open it up to the floor to answer questions and we may call Elias and Jocelyn in as we go. Sure. Just a question about Mr. Power, we are not about SMR, SMR, and you consider using SMR and would that to connect with SMR and would that to some extent really do you stay is the need for large essentials of planet for life? So I think that there's a definitional question there so this is based on just a cost per megawatt for installed capacity of a nuclear power plant that could be an SMR it could be a larger plant I think there's a question of what those costs will be which is why we did a variability of different costs and there's also a question of where these would be installed. What do we install them in the peace region where it's definitely stable geographically versus sticking them on the outside of Angover Islands in Port Alber where there might be a tsunami, probably not the best place to put them. So there's lots of assumptions there about how nuclear might or might not work. I haven't seen any evidence that SMRs are in terms of costs going to be drastically different and bigger power plant. But that's a question we can ask. We can play with different prices in the model. We can play with different locations. So looking at where those transmission bottlenecks are, and could be installed in different places. But the model doesn'tulator is put out there in terms of the future's projections. And so we've pulled those into the model at this point. Definitely a lot of work to do with demand projections in terms of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and different levels of different pieces. Some of those assumptions that Canadian energy regulators has provided some really good information on and others, there needs to be some work to do on that. I know the province is very interesting as well. Yes. Thank you for the presentation. I think that you almost answered the first question. The question was about how the modeling corporates population were. Right model incorporates population growth. And the second question is about offshore winds. I noticed that it's not there. There are many barriers for modern, I'm sure. How difficult would be, would it be to incorporate offshore? Because some people would say that that's probably one of the other. Great. Yeah, absolutely. So great question. Yeah, the population will currently the Canadian Energy Regulator does have some population demands in and there's not one demand profile. There's a number of them that we can pull in from the Canadian Undergulator, but that is definitely a question as well. I don't give them the immigration different changes that happen with government. Those projections are variable And so having some variability on those projections in the modeling, absolutely something we can add in there. And then offshore wind, it can be added as a technology. It currently isn't. And I'm not sure, actually, there's no real reason why it isn't in there other than it just hasn't been turned on I think I think the capabilities are in there yeah. I like I like both of these population growth the reason for choosing the Canadian energy Future was that they have their own model of demand projection which is like enclosing a demographic growth and like other necessary demands and like projections from the government which they didn't like exclusively raise the data like how that if the projection, transmission, projection in some of the largest region goes in. So we adopt their data because all goes into their model, including the population, and they give us the data. But to go in the run, like kernel living cases of any kind of activities, we can plug into the model and see what happens. For offshore wind, as far as it's mostly from scoping the work. Because as you said, offshore wind invites lots of uncertainties in terms of modeling and stuff. But if we can restrict our questions and like how much we want to build which area we want to plug in and offshore that that could be help us to define these options as well because offshore wind involves lots of weather data involvement so that may like create the computation really complex. So that was the only reason. I think the other related piece of an officer win is near the load center here, our shorelines are very steep, and so you get down to 1,000 feet very quickly. and then here there's a bit more shallow places so there is some some discussion of putting offshore wind here but then you also have the issue of connecting that up to the load center so those are related challenges all of which can be definitely looked at which I'm on the back. Thank you. So in for a presentation of the cycle one of the energy options that I was not I was seeing in considering here on earlier this morning. We have the same issues, a few projects that are the term started when you see it representing the distribution. We have the same, for the most comparable volume resources as those in the ice in and based on the world of the source. So I guess my question is why have been one of the different levels in Northern Data might be in the different direction. I think geothermal is one of the, same with offshore wind, it's getting the right data in it and easy to model that. Because we don't have a lot of it right now, I think is part of the reason why it hasn't been looked at in more detail. Do you have more spoke geothermal? Yeah, thank you you. There's a great question. So as you have seen our modeling tools, we have kind of designed the whole thing as a modular tools to answer different like key pieces of the MOICs. So we have built a, I kind of, that that was focused on my research as well, to be the tool, which is called resource. We've been releasing it so in the GitHub, like on the source. So resource initially looks at solar and wind, but it is a kind of building that we can expand it to explore the resource options for geothermal as well. It's, there are definitely proven metrics to address that, but it was kind of due to the coping issues, and also looking at the integrated just planning for DC hydro, it seems it's better to use our scope to best explore the wind and solar, like the onshore wind and solar. But it's not a limitation. It's a it's not a limitation. It's a it's a scoping in issue, definitely I would be doing into expanding the resource relations. We want Elias to graduate with his PhD. I'm keeping forever, but he wouldn't be happy with that. Yes. Thank you. I thought I saw an earlier slide. Something about including environmental values and justice considerations in the model. How is that a little factor? So, yeah, great question. I really, that's something that I'm really passionate about also wanting to do some of that. Environmental considerations, I think the climate emissions, those are the big pieces there, but then also the land use with the nexus model. We didn't show results of that, but we didn't have land use modeling as well as a water use modeling for our land. So if we're growing crops, how much water we use and pieces like that. So those environmental pieces, they come into the modeling at different scope. Some of the big picture model of the whole province, you can't get down to sort of what's happening on a given field in terms of the environment, but we can add externalities in there of what those impacts might be and how to piece those together. You want to answer to well, go for it. I want to get a slide. Oh, that's great. So that's the one piece. Those environmental pieces. Those environmental pieces, those are relatively easy to quantify. The energy justice pieces are a lot more challenging. I'm actually working with a profit and resource environment and planning department. Try to look at how do we actually do those energy justice, energy access clusters. Having done work in various countries, including Kenya, where I do know they have a lot of geothermal. Those are really valid questions and they're challenging the model. But I have been with that problem looking at sort of a structure of how we do the modeling where we do some community engagement both the pre and post and during the modeling and try and sort of build it in that way. It's something that as an engineer I haven't really figured out. I wish there was a nice easy answer and they could just check it off and do it, but it's not it's one of those hard things to do but really really important. How do we look at so we know demand isn't going to increase. Part of that is also that sometimes we have to acknowledge that energy policy may not address equity, so we might need a suite of policies, because addressing climate change, by definition, is going to cost some people more than others. And how do we equitably distribute that, and how do we have policy suites that make sure that equity is included in those pieces? Very complex question. Very interesting question. One of the challenges as a researcher in natural sciences and engineering funding the body and you talk about equity and how we're going to do that in modeling and they're like, I don't know, that's not our box. And then my colleague Andrea And Goyan out of the planning department talks to Shirk and says we want to do modeling type stuff and sure it's like that's not our box and so we're sort of trying to piece those pieces together, find the right pieces for that funding. A very, very interesting piece that I'd really love to get some long-term sustained funding to actually address effectively. We got a small little grant and we had some really good conversations, even just learning about words we each use. Sometimes they were going, their research group was talking about one thing, when we were talking about another thing, but we realized we were actually talking about the same thing. We were just using different words. So some of that requires time and connection and figuring those pieces out. And that's really interesting, but really challenging. I'm going to go there. I don't know who is that. Do you want to go? Oh, I just want to put another lens on your question. So I just want to put another lens on your question. So when it starts with a simple question, like where are the fantastic wind and solar resources and like how to find them. So that was a very simple question, but why don't we try to dig into the data level and to the location, geospatial data level, because we want to see how it reacts to the system, if we inject these kind of resources. So it tends to very deep level questions like, where are the lands available? And if you drill down down you need information to pick up the lands. A simple filter like power living for land player and find out resources. But it's not as simple as it looks because you need to have data. Open source updated data of land owner information, what treaties are in between the entities covering which area. Like recently, Albert introduced to the individual ball, which is like 20 kilometer buffer, around some of the provincial regions. So how do you plan along with these things? You need a simple tool because you can see to draw a circle and put it a resolution. And when it comes to that level in terms of Canada, there are tools like NRL's tools which addresses very nice questions about USA because they have a nice file of all regulatory data in the modeling level, you just pulling the data into the model, as simple as that. But when you go into, like, what are the land treaties associated to that part of the region? How do we translate this policy information to a specific region? So that knowledge and like the data gap is really stressing to model these issues. Another concern is like when you go down to the hydro cascading level modeling, there's water treaty like water is a very complex thing which involves lot of flora, fauna and lots of treaties along with different entities. So that is very hard to get information. We use like a very old statistical information for our model. But we created the structure, placeholder there, use the data, whatever available. So it's always, for me, for my point of view, it's always a data efficiency that Canada or particularly needs to answer some of the very nice questions. So that's howup question on the environment. I'm more technical. In your model, are you able to score, are you targeting the emission package? So great energy, and you recalculate these, these kind of new capacity and everything. And do you consider energy training? Because that becomes point three. A few years ago, the ignition package changed abruptly, just because they were changing their calculations, how you would energy training. This is something that you would happen in the model. And another question I have perhaps is about solar and means. If you could tell us what's the source of data or the wind speed are you using global address and real? What sort of data? The first one, the first one, the brain is not, yeah, the emissions. The emissions factor, right, yeah. So the emissions factors for the technologies within BC are included in the model and so tracking all the emissions within BC are in there The trade question is quite complex So we have some strategies for how we deal with trade to different jurisdictions and the emissions factors that go along with that They're all all flawed in some ways, but you don't sort of have to do some things. So we do have different ways of doing that. Depending on the specific scenario, what you're looking for, we can make it the details of how that works. But those are are definitely challenging questions to answer for sure and then you ask about data for wind and solar. So I want to come to remember the first question as well. So for emission accounting we have some proven mathematical like thumb rule numbers to account the and use twales and their initial factors based on using these fully in some technologies so if we're sorry we control it but we can also get from the data like we can consider the exhaust outside of the model model work emission as well in our modeling accounting to meet up certain levels of emission. So we have a limited model world which includes some of the sectors. If there are emissions outside of this model world, we can plug it in and also consider this holistic emission level to meet up certain that zero carbon and certain meters. So that's how we kind of try to address this. For the varied data sources, it's a different treatment for solar and wind. For solar, we went up era 5 data. So the era 5 has re-analysis global data, which is kind of periodically updated every year, which point of time. So we are using that. We are using the same data for wind as well, but there's a problem in wind that when you go down to the wind and this is a small cell you can see here the small boxes this is the resolution of air-5 data 30 kilometer roughly 27.8 kilowatt. So when you go down to the wind, a wind speed varies a lot in this region. So we need to correct this bias in the air-of-ythe data and we source that global wind atlas data like a high resolution level to correct this bias. So we take the profile, global wind unfortunately doesn't provide any profiling data, it provides a static data for a certain region for a year. The fun thing is that global wind and plus itself uses zero-fide data to calculate their data. So they have their medical model, but we don't want to go into that level. So what do we do is we go into ERA-5 to take their profile, we adjust the data, the profile, the scale of the data with the Global the global media. And we check that for existing resources, it kind of solves a lot of our over-restigration and other institutions. We have very detailed analysis on that, but we'll be happy to do. So that's how we kind of address it. And for the technologies, we can use any technology wind turbine in existing market and I in this day if the current data is there. Currently you are sourcing the turbines from open energy data base. Any turbine we can feed in like they have a good source they plug it in a data. And this there are five data provides means that you can half-pights. Yeah, yeah. And we are using a tool called a light which can adjust the wind speed according to the half-right or with the. You need to go the shape factor for the location. It's respective of the house. But we have a mathematical model so it can plug in like other options to have just this calculation or the translation from weather speed applied to capacity factor. So my question was more impartiality. How much are you factoring in interplay from Alberta and it increases in the lowest five? Are planning? Is that factoring material at all? Currently, I don't think it is. But that's, so we can build a scenario that looks at that. At this point, we're not looking at that. Trade is very complicated. So the, and yeah, the question is how do you represent that region? You represent it as a generator with load, you represent it as given flows across the border. So there's different assumption that can be made there depending on which model we're running as well. Steve results don't have any of that in that, but that is definitely an next step that we can use. Let's go over there. I'm going to the last side of the room for all. Thank you. The question is, the solar energy and the new energy is, it's not the same thing. Yes. It's a highly highly equal to the right receiving some kind of device with the nuclear is actually more there. So so you will consider the difference in it. Right. So the two models do different things. The classic expansion big picture model has a we can vary the number of time sizes in it, but the more time sizes we have the longer than the run time. But we can do things like we can say, okay, well, we're going to have a night time when there's no solar, so because they have to deal with that in daytime and there is solar. And so that model sort of looks at, is the energy there roughly in the right times, but isn't going to look at those details? And then the pipe some model looks at those very specific details of this hour, based on the weather profile we put into that, there was this much wind on this hour, this much solar on this hour, and therefore we have to run this much hydro and this much, yeah, and pieces it together so that every single hour we know new world is the new world. So I think that's the power lines is offering this all about the VP of the chain of trade. So that's how we're facing. Right. So that is an externality. I think that goes back a little bit to the sort of environmental impact. So I don't think that a model like this can take you to account if there's a nuclear explosion in this or big leak or something like that, what that means. That's a policy question that the government and the society has to make. Is there are risks with nuclear? There's risks with nuclear. There's risks with nuclear. There's risks with nuclear. There's risks with wind solar. There's risks with hydro bands do fail. Rarely. So the question is really it's a balancing of risks, which is not a engineering modeling question. Some of the planning and some of the sort of equity justice questions that come along with sort of that policy government level are very interesting. The model itself doesn't really address those. It says if you decide to do nuclear, here's what the system runs like, here's where the grid challenges are, here's how the system works. If you decide not to do nuclear, we need a whole pile of wind to do that, and here's what that looks like for the system. If we do solar, here's the land we have to take up, so we can't grow our blueberries in the Fraser Valley because there's a solar panel one there, or maybe with climate change, the solar panels can be put on there. That's actually, Jossum's quite interesting, as the agriolephysics. So could we shape the blueberry plants, so we get better blueberry yield as climate heats up with the solar panels. Maybe there's things like that. Those are the questions that the model can address. And then society with some of that consultation, maybe some of the work we're doing here. And the question we ask here is, how can we work together? Maybe some of you are in that policy space and would like to work and run the model to see how that works. And if you want to compliment on the interredency information, so if you want to model that interagency, so any kind of model you do in the world, you have to put in the resources as a letter or any kind of analysis, you have to put the data for a weather year, right? So that weather year, you have to be putting a lot of assumptions. Which weather you want to use? You can analyze 10 years of data, come up with a hypothetical year. So that is an open field of research. We kind of assume there is a data pipeline. So in the end of plugging different weather, it's their data. But from my analysis, I have analyzed like 10 shares of previous data. There is no like specific variance between the data like the weather pattern, unless there's a drop happening somewhere so that's how we can do but the government should the government researching should really develop some standard weather you data for Canadian government like provinces then we can plug in the letter and see how the whole agreement. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I fully appreciate the complexity of the model and all the parameters that you might be using. Some better than others, some more reliable than others. My question is, how do you calibrate your model? So how do you know that the other person is reliably or accurate enough? Yeah, great question. I think there's a couple of challenges in that. So validation is always a question of these sorts of models. They're unfortunately not physical models. So the ideal for validation is you build a physical example. You run your model, you run the physical thing. If they match, you have some validation because you have this experiment. We can't do that because we have one earth and we can't sort of, it'd be nice if we had a thousand of nurse and we say, okay, these ones are going to get a treatment of 500 hearts per million CO2, these ones are going to get a 450, what happens to them, we can do that. That would be ideal. So the validation is challenging because we're looking at the future. It's also an optimization model, so it's not representing the physical of what decisions actually get made. So politically we may or may not be nuclear even if the model says we do nuclear so that's a that there's that humanity does weird things which isn't optimal so there's that validation challenge as well. So some of the validation that you can do with this, so the model frameworks can actually run behind this without the data have been used in various different places for various different things. And so there's a good academic literature on the model frameworks that says these are suitable for purpose and so that's the first part is that the model frameworks we say these are decent model frameworks they do well people have tested them with all sorts of different scenarios they do the the things that they expect them to do, they're not randomly choosing to install only geothermal for everything because some weird thing happens. So that's the validation of the modeling framework itself. The data then is the next base is validating that data, how good is our data. So some of that is looking at historical data. So do students some high backcasting. So do we get, if we run the solar for 2015, does it look like solar for 2015 and then do we feel comfortable casting it forward some of that is really testing the model of extremities so if nuclear is free what happens in the model if nuclear is really expensive what happens the model, making sure that the model is reacting reasonably to those differences. And so those are sort of some of the strategies we use, but it's definitely a challenge to validate, because there's no physical example that we can run this thing on it. So which would be great. If you could invent that, we'd be very happy. Yes. I want to go back to the weather data at Convention. Is there a forecast data that you can put in some weather data with change and how it's really in the climate danger? That's a great question. So our model takes in like agnostically takes in the data as a format like provided from AI. So it doesn't know it's a forecasted data or the existing data. So our model doesn't handle like climate projections and stuff like that. But we can use the data produced from climate models as an input to the model. So yeah, so it doesn't handle say this is the baseline data or what happens if the climate projections go to different lines of path. So we don't deal with this one, further than we use this produce data for that model. But most of the forecast data we know is like most expensive data sets. And we like our philosophy is more likely developing the pipeline of open source data sets and we like our philosophy is more likely they look in the pipeline of the pencils data sets but the capabilities are there if you can go and the page version of the pipeline it will end the same. And there are some of those projections we have all been for different scenarios so they are they do exist I don't remember a specific projection we use for these ones but yeah that's definitely part of the customers figure out some of those pieces yes so the scope of this is obviously province wide and this is kind of touched on with data resolution and availability. Sounds like it's pretty flexible overall, but is it possible to drill down to a certain region and make citing decisions for a particular project if you're able to incorporate higher resolution data sets? I think besides specific sighting I think we can get a general this region this area this 30 by 30 sort of common yeah within say central organagan not not within one field. So we've started sort of front of the end of saying like this 30 by 30 grid seems to have good resources, but getting more detailed with that I don't think is something. So our, the resource assessment that provides this data set, it's sensitive to different issues like the proximity to existing infrastructure. It could be a road light, it could be a transmission line. It could be some specific sites you want to use like existing power facilities. So it can put different sensitivities to calculate what are my in favor of zones. Currently the line you see here is like 2GX regions divided, 3G8 administrative regions, regional districts. So there's the resolution we're diving to right now. We can simply a bargain like select one region and see if other analyzes and develop some other sensitivity just for a region. And there's flexibility in terms of the data that goes in. So if you had better data for one region, you could. Yeah, we can do that. It says simple data data figures so you can use that. Data is always the challenge. So what of the time with the question is do we have. And then development costs, stuff like it, but we don't have good information for Canada. But it's open there. There's a one number for is the bank cost of Saturday. Okay. So if I got it right, did you say that you are going to release the open source resources? Yes, so the model itself, the modeling frameworks are all openly licensed and we pull those in and then the workflows for getting all the data and getting to these points, that is all going to be up on getting up. Yes. Thank you. We are developing some testing and some examples of interviews with the conservation of the stakeholders. And myself, we have received. I'm using my connections as well to failure some of our data and cigarettes. I have some setting checks. Then there will be along with the models source scores, we will be releasing the number. Plus, some of the things need to be published after I published my paper. So that's a kind of a motivation. So how do you think is, like what do you think are important additions to the existing information that we have in terms of data? So unfortunately, like major share of the data we can release into public based on the source, their pharmacy. So we might have to release the scripts and the pipeline, automated pipeline, where you can set up your own APA setup and like registration and stuff. It's mostly open source global data. Some of information, there's a proprietary is like very detailed information of the substation, very detailed information of the line reading, right of way of the line. So some property information are there. But these are like, depends on what sensitivity or what question was about to ask the model. So that will guide what data you may be not in the detail you want. So the information either is available or the information on where you get the information is available. So we can't release certain bits of information because we don't have ownership of that information, but we can tell you if you go talk to those people, they'll release that to you. So yeah. Awesome, thanks. I think your handle was up earlier, so go ahead. Yeah, perfect. Well, I was going to save this last night. Some fellow scientists as well, and I know that all models are wrong. Yep. Some models are used. So other than getting your PhD, what you hope these models model. Excellent question. So it was asked specifically of you. So I'll say the general group concept. So I would like this model to be useful. It's actually an interesting place being a modeler as an academic because I have to admit that everything I do is wrong. Sort of fun place to be."}]}
