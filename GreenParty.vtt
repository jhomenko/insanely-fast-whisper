WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
With over two decades working in the environmental consulting and local government fields.

00:05.120 --> 00:09.080
From leading waste reduction programs on the Sunshine Coast,

00:09.420 --> 00:13.020
to championing natural asset management in Gibsons,

00:13.300 --> 00:16.500
to advocating for public transit and EV infrastructure,

00:17.160 --> 00:19.300
Jeremy's career has been rooted in sustainability.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.540
And now, as the first BC Green member elected on the mainland,

00:24.920 --> 00:27.420
he's helping shape a new chapter for the party.

00:27.420 --> 00:33.840
So in this session, we'll hear from Jeremy on his reflections on the direction that the BC Greens are headed in,

00:34.320 --> 00:41.540
the party's clean energy priorities, and we'll also dive into how those policies intersect with the realities

00:41.540 --> 00:44.000
many of us are navigating on the ground.

00:44.520 --> 00:49.380
From permitting to procurement, to indigenous partnerships, and economic realities.

00:50.420 --> 00:53.240
So with that, please join me in welcoming Jeremy and Mary.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.980
Thanks. Okay, that works.

01:01.060 --> 01:01.580
Thanks, Ina.

01:02.600 --> 01:09.080
So I'm really happy to be here, and it's very familiar to me because as a young engineer and environmental consultant,

01:09.340 --> 01:13.740
in the 2000s, I used to attend these conferences back when it was IPBBC.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.520
Some of you probably remember that, and I do see a few familiar faces.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.860
So it's great to be brought up to speed, and it's great to be on the cusp of a new age for this industry.

01:24.140 --> 01:29.920
I know that 15 years has been a long time, but there's a lot of excitement in this room.

01:30.240 --> 01:37.140
So I got to work on small hydro projects in the Cleveland Valley, the Upper Bridge, Vancouver Island,

01:37.140 --> 01:44.940
and up north as working on environmental mitigation and engineering constraints.

01:45.280 --> 01:50.260
So, and now I'm an elected representative for the BC Greens.

01:50.700 --> 01:56.220
It's a bit of a strange journey through local government, but we've elected two Green MLAs.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.420
Neither of us returning.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.960
We're brand new, so we're in a steep learning curve.

01:59.960 --> 02:06.840
But right after the election, very tight election, as you remember, we were thrown into a negotiation with the government

02:06.840 --> 02:12.540
to support them on budget and confidence motions, and we were able to agree on a series of projects

02:12.540 --> 02:19.240
that we were going to work on together, shared priorities, health, housing, transit, forests, electoral reform.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.960
The one that's probably of most interest to you is a full review of the Clean BC Climate Plan,

02:23.960 --> 02:29.140
which is a year ahead of schedule, and we agreed the science is moving quickly.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.660
We, the needs for energy are changing quickly.

02:32.780 --> 02:37.660
So we've worked very closely with Minister Dix to establish some terms of reference

02:37.660 --> 02:39.540
and then select expert panelists.

02:40.500 --> 02:47.840
Maren Smith and Dan Vanilovic probably don't need any introduction in this room,

02:47.940 --> 02:52.020
but they bring a lot of expertise to this table.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.680
And so with input from stakeholders and the public and the Climate Solutions Council,

02:56.680 --> 03:00.680
they are doing a full review that's supposed to be finished by October.

03:00.820 --> 03:05.820
So I know people think of a review as a bit of a yawner and won't produce anything for you,

03:05.880 --> 03:08.960
but this is a pretty critical stage for our climate plan.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.220
As you know, we haven't been meeting our targets.

03:12.220 --> 03:19.100
And we've unfortunately in a bit of a lull in terms of public enthusiasm for climate action.

03:19.100 --> 03:27.020
I'm hoping and I'm very confident that it's cyclical and we will resume our focus on climate

03:27.020 --> 03:29.540
when we get through some of these other challenges that we're facing.

03:29.540 --> 03:33.560
But we're not meeting our targets and we need to figure out how to do that.

03:33.680 --> 03:41.960
So updating from the 2018 plan and the scope for these reviewers is everything's on the table.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.840
We're looking for a transformative change.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.600
We're looking for a paradigm shift in how we tackle climate.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.540
And this industry will be a huge part of that.

03:50.620 --> 03:56.640
I'm not going to prejudge their results, but I know that electrification will be a major push.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.040
So we're really excited for the previous call to power and the one that's coming up.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.500
All of you are leading the way in this.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.320
And government should be listening to you.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.720
I'm really encouraged to hear some of the earlier presentations.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.620
We're beating IEA projections for solar.

04:13.700 --> 04:17.140
First Nations financing seems to be making major strides.

04:17.140 --> 04:26.200
So what our Green Caucus thinks that we need is an overarching vision for power in this province.

04:26.300 --> 04:31.800
Instead of lurching from call to call 15 years apart and rebates get brought in, rebates get cancelled,

04:32.360 --> 04:35.260
we need a big picture energy pathways assessment.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.000
And so a lot has been done.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.740
There's been a big rush.

04:39.940 --> 04:43.140
The tariff threat has caused this government to move quickly.

04:43.940 --> 04:45.100
And in some ways that can be good.

04:45.100 --> 04:55.160
But I have lived the permitting juggernaut, or sorry, the permitting gauntlet of 15 different ministries and 15 different permits.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.440
I'm glad to see a one-window option.

05:00.340 --> 05:03.340
As we all know, the BC Energy Regulatory hasn't been involved in this before,

05:03.340 --> 05:07.820
so we're very concerned to see what their process will look like and how they'll tackle this.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.960
And it's great to have Michelle speak to that earlier.

05:11.960 --> 05:18.340
So we're looking at proposed legislation from this government that has some pretty significant changes

05:18.340 --> 05:24.700
about how energy projects are assessed, including the major North Coast transmission line.

05:24.700 --> 05:30.340
So if it promotes streamlining and it creates a one-window, that's great.

05:30.420 --> 05:34.440
But we also need to make sure that we don't rush to get this wrong.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.520
So we need to get this right.

05:36.520 --> 05:42.040
And I know we all, and I share the frustration, the government moves can move quite slowly.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.360
But to take some of these bills, Bill 7 is the most notable one that you'll have heard of.

05:47.500 --> 05:53.960
Bills 14 and 15 are streamlining but concentrating a huge amount of power in the cabinet

05:53.960 --> 05:57.420
rather than putting it through the legislature when you're duly elected representatives.

05:57.420 --> 06:06.580
So to think that these bills will go from a draft 10 days ago to being law by the end of May,

06:06.640 --> 06:10.520
that is extremely quick, and we believe that they need the proper screening.

06:11.660 --> 06:17.600
So that's our job, to make sure that we don't sacrifice the rigor of environmental assessment

06:17.600 --> 06:21.580
and the social license that we all know that we get from proper consultation.

06:21.580 --> 06:27.640
So I can't stress enough that the B.C. Greens obviously support development of renewable energy

06:27.640 --> 06:33.040
and are supportive of ways to speed this up so we can get these things built.

06:33.860 --> 06:39.980
But we are very wary of living too fast and seeing a social backlash.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.900
And we know that there is resistance to some of these, some communities.

06:44.020 --> 06:50.540
So you bring communities along, allow First Nations to participate, and those are key to success.

06:50.540 --> 06:57.060
We haven't heard that from some of the stakeholders so far, so we'll be examining the extent of this bill

06:57.060 --> 07:02.560
and these bills and trying to figure out how to make them work.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.180
So I don't, yeah, I'm not here to monologue.

07:06.360 --> 07:13.920
Actually, I think Ina has one question, but I'd actually like to hear some questions from you,

07:13.980 --> 07:18.060
but I also want to have statements in the form of questions because really you are the experts.

07:18.060 --> 07:22.520
You've been dealing with this regulatory regime and this industry for years,

07:22.700 --> 07:27.540
and I'd like to know how the province can harness the potential that's in this room.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.680
And this really, clean energy should be non-partisan.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.160
This is about how we, this is the way forward.

07:34.260 --> 07:37.600
We all know this is the way forward, and we have to, we have some catching up to do.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.980
But it should not be driven by partisanship.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.140
So please think of a question or a statement.

07:44.280 --> 07:48.380
I'd like to hear your thoughts on the bringing in of the BC Energy Regulator

07:48.380 --> 07:51.740
and some of the other industry conditions and constraints.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.860
And I'll go ahead and take one question first.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.100
Okay, sounds good.

07:56.100 --> 08:01.940
I did have five questions prepared, but Amelie Valeria was really eager to hear from the room,

08:02.120 --> 08:05.560
so I'll ask my one, and then we'll open it up to the floor.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.640
So thank you so much, Jeremy.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.360
There's obviously a lot of thought going into the Greens approach,

08:10.580 --> 08:14.320
and I know that everyone in the room is eager to connect that vision

08:14.320 --> 08:17.200
to the work that we're doing in the clean energy sector,

08:17.380 --> 08:20.260
so especially when it comes to delivering projects on the ground.

08:20.260 --> 08:23.520
So my one question before we turn to the floor.

08:24.280 --> 08:30.980
Your election 2024, most recently, last fall,

08:32.320 --> 08:36.460
rightly identified the election platform document that your party put out,

08:37.180 --> 08:39.900
rightly identified the need for long-term procurement targets

08:39.900 --> 08:41.640
and workforce development.

08:42.180 --> 08:45.260
As someone trying to plan and finance these projects,

08:45.960 --> 08:47.960
I say predictability is everything.

08:47.960 --> 08:52.540
So what would a stable, investor-friendly, clean energy plan look like

08:52.540 --> 08:54.600
from a BC Green perspective,

08:54.820 --> 08:59.920
one that delivers both on climate outcomes and economic certainty?

08:59.980 --> 09:03.680
I know you touched on it a little bit, but let us know.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.460
What's your plan?

09:05.140 --> 09:08.120
Yeah, I mean, I think we all know that predictability is key,

09:08.300 --> 09:11.740
and it's, like I've said, lurching between calls for power every 15 years

09:11.740 --> 09:14.020
doesn't work.

09:14.020 --> 09:19.960
I think, you know, the key piece for us is, like I said,

09:20.020 --> 09:23.760
government needs to articulate a vision and how we're going to get there.

09:24.220 --> 09:27.360
I think, you know, like any enterprise, there should be,

09:27.580 --> 09:30.400
you know, there needs to be targets that we actually make.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.600
The climate targets are excessively frustrating

09:33.600 --> 09:36.320
because there's really no consequences to not meeting them,

09:36.320 --> 09:39.360
and that's really not the way that we should be.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.420
They need to be linked to some kind of consequences.

09:42.220 --> 09:46.060
We're extremely keen on supporting technological innovation,

09:46.340 --> 09:49.560
so, you know, the fact that geothermal and battery storage

09:49.560 --> 09:52.660
is included in this call is really, really important,

09:52.660 --> 09:57.020
and all the other innovation that's taking place.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.200
We've just heard a whole lot about solar and energy,

10:00.360 --> 10:01.500
community energy co-ops.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.780
We do have a paradigm shift to make in this province.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.740
It's not all resource extraction.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.240
We can be a clean Canada, can be an energy superpower.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.880
We need to look at domestic use,

10:15.280 --> 10:18.120
and then the certainty that comes with funding and training

10:18.120 --> 10:21.620
and job creation, we'll hear about skilled trades,

10:21.760 --> 10:25.860
so we need to set the foundation for this now.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.300
I mean, well, we needed to be setting it five to ten years ago,

10:29.380 --> 10:31.400
and that's where we need to say,

10:31.580 --> 10:32.460
we know where we're going.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.840
BC Hydro might be building a big hydro-powered dam,

10:35.880 --> 10:37.440
but we know we're going to need more energy,

10:37.580 --> 10:40.760
and so this, you know, we saw the curves

10:40.760 --> 10:43.300
versus the IEA projections on solar,

10:43.300 --> 10:47.820
and I think we need to be bullish about planning for this for the future,

10:47.820 --> 10:48.640
and be bold.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.980
Any questions from the floor,

10:53.100 --> 10:54.940
or should I go to the rest of the questions?

10:57.860 --> 10:59.600
Well, it's a good thing I prepped five.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.500
Thanks for sticking with us to the end of the day.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.980
So you touched on it a little bit,

11:06.080 --> 11:08.160
but let's expand on it a little bit further.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.480
Given today's geopolitical and economic uncertainties,

11:11.480 --> 11:14.580
energy security is coming up more and more.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.180
How do the Greens view energy sovereignty,

11:17.180 --> 11:19.740
and what role should renewable energy play

11:19.740 --> 11:21.980
in strengthening BC's self-sufficiency?

11:23.840 --> 11:28.100
Yeah, I mean, energy security, energy sovereignty,

11:28.100 --> 11:30.420
and sovereignty is clearly important,

11:30.420 --> 11:35.640
and, you know, in the discussions about an east-west energy grid,

11:36.260 --> 11:39.740
I think, you know, and this crisis does create an opportunity

11:39.740 --> 11:41.980
for us to find those,

11:42.180 --> 11:44.580
and, you know, part of Bill 7

11:44.580 --> 11:47.260
is about decreasing inter-provincial trade barriers.

11:47.780 --> 11:49.560
I guess I just want to draw the distinction

11:49.560 --> 11:51.920
between energy sovereignty and home,

11:52.040 --> 11:55.500
and the supply of energy that we need here

11:55.500 --> 11:58.520
versus massive exports of gas,

11:58.700 --> 12:00.220
of the provide gas.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.360
So to the Greens, that's a climate disaster,

12:04.360 --> 12:07.960
and it's not necessarily part of our energy sovereignty.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.000
We'd like to live within our borders,

12:10.660 --> 12:13.560
you know, use the resources that we have here

12:13.560 --> 12:16.640
to strengthen that sovereignty

12:16.640 --> 12:19.300
and move forward with that.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.140
It's not necessarily about export.

12:22.140 --> 12:25.880
And I think, you know, the transition is key

12:25.880 --> 12:28.600
to where we land in this.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.080
If the U.S. is going to back away from renewables,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.920
then maybe that's an opportunity for us.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.420
I know you're not all seeing that on the ground yet,

12:35.620 --> 12:37.740
but that's what we would hope to, you know,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.520
create those conditions that allow that to happen.

12:40.820 --> 12:41.620
Okay, thank you.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.780
I see that we've got one question that's come in.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.420
So the question is,

12:48.420 --> 12:50.640
what specifically do the B.C. Greens want to change

12:50.640 --> 12:51.520
with Bill 14?

12:51.960 --> 12:54.060
Is there a balance between regulatory efficiency

12:54.060 --> 12:55.240
and environmental protections?

12:56.180 --> 12:56.660
Yeah, thanks.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.040
That's a great question.

12:58.340 --> 13:00.800
It's trying to achieve that balance.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.620
And Bill 14 is, I'll say,

13:04.700 --> 13:06.840
less challenging for us than Bill 15

13:06.840 --> 13:09.100
because Bill 15 is just a blanket cabinet

13:09.100 --> 13:11.100
that determines what's a significant project

13:11.100 --> 13:12.160
and it goes ahead.

13:12.420 --> 13:16.060
It could be a very streamlined environmental assessment process

13:16.060 --> 13:17.660
that is essentially what cabinets,

13:17.660 --> 13:18.660
cabinet decides.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.940
Bill 14 is, you know,

13:21.980 --> 13:22.900
it's about renewable energy,

13:23.060 --> 13:25.500
so we are trying to be supportive.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.720
We're trying to work our ways through it.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.840
But the changes that we want

13:29.840 --> 13:31.940
are really about transparency and oversight.

13:34.080 --> 13:34.620
If, you know,

13:34.700 --> 13:37.060
if B.C. Energy regulator is going to regulate these,

13:37.120 --> 13:37.500
that's great.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.140
They're currently not as transparent

13:39.140 --> 13:40.940
as, say, the Environmental Assessment Office,

13:41.060 --> 13:42.220
but also the cabinet decisions

13:42.220 --> 13:43.720
that are going to set that process

13:43.720 --> 13:46.380
need to be transparent

13:46.380 --> 13:47.620
and they need to be accountable.

13:48.140 --> 13:48.720
It's, you know,

13:48.720 --> 13:49.320
with Bill 7,

13:49.420 --> 13:50.360
we agreed that we would

13:50.360 --> 13:53.920
have a legislative committee of all parties

13:53.920 --> 13:55.000
to make it nonpartisan,

13:55.200 --> 13:56.440
have a look at the regulations

13:56.440 --> 13:58.900
after they're established.

13:59.180 --> 14:00.500
And at least that gives the opportunity

14:00.500 --> 14:03.060
to point out what's not working,

14:03.300 --> 14:04.700
find the unintended consequences

14:04.700 --> 14:06.940
and maybe change course.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.380
If it's all done behind closed doors

14:09.380 --> 14:09.800
of the cabinet,

14:09.960 --> 14:12.720
then that's not going to work.

14:12.860 --> 14:13.100
It's not,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.160
that's going to build more mistrust

14:15.160 --> 14:15.560
in government

14:15.560 --> 14:16.920
and it's going to create more of a backlash,

14:17.040 --> 14:19.200
which I don't want any of you to see

14:19.200 --> 14:20.200
because I think these projects

14:20.200 --> 14:21.180
are really important.

14:21.380 --> 14:26.420
So the balance is more about transparency

14:26.420 --> 14:28.260
and oversight of making sure

14:28.260 --> 14:29.040
that these processes

14:29.040 --> 14:30.200
don't get short-circuited

14:30.200 --> 14:32.100
and to the detriment

14:32.100 --> 14:33.700
of really all of us.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.480
Okay, thank you.

14:36.140 --> 14:37.960
I think we've got time

14:37.960 --> 14:40.300
for just one last quick follow-up question.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.720
It's actually a question

14:41.720 --> 14:42.460
that I put together

14:42.460 --> 14:44.300
and I feel like it goes hand-in-hand

14:44.300 --> 14:45.900
with the one that was just asked.

14:46.460 --> 14:47.540
Specifically around,

14:48.080 --> 14:49.480
I feel like your party

14:49.480 --> 14:50.520
has been a little bit critical.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.980
I watch for the question period

14:51.980 --> 14:53.660
and I've seen some of the remarks

14:53.660 --> 14:54.840
or heard some of the remarks

14:54.840 --> 14:56.940
with regard to the most recent procurement,

14:57.940 --> 14:59.280
pricing, so on and so forth,

14:59.280 --> 15:00.400
and obviously permitting reform.

15:00.860 --> 15:01.980
As someone working directly

15:01.980 --> 15:03.980
in the industry and sector,

15:04.120 --> 15:04.840
I'm curious,

15:05.380 --> 15:06.600
who are you consulting with

15:06.600 --> 15:08.040
to form these positions?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.740
Are you talking to developers,

15:10.660 --> 15:12.080
Indigenous nations as partners,

15:12.800 --> 15:14.940
local communities as part of that dialogue

15:14.940 --> 15:16.620
or does it mostly happen

15:16.620 --> 15:18.900
within the policy and advocacy sphere

15:18.900 --> 15:19.600
and circles?

15:20.440 --> 15:21.660
Yeah, great question.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.160
Victoria can be a bit of a bubble

15:24.160 --> 15:25.360
and that's, you know,

15:25.820 --> 15:27.920
I've spent a lot of time there

15:27.920 --> 15:28.620
in the last few months

15:28.620 --> 15:29.300
and I'm looking forward

15:29.300 --> 15:30.280
to getting back to,

15:31.160 --> 15:32.520
back to, you know,

15:32.560 --> 15:33.760
get grounded in the sea and sky

15:33.760 --> 15:34.960
and the rest of the province.

15:35.240 --> 15:35.800
So there is,

15:35.940 --> 15:37.240
there is some, you know,

15:37.280 --> 15:38.760
policy pieces

15:38.760 --> 15:39.840
that is a bit disconnected

15:39.840 --> 15:40.300
in Victoria.

15:41.380 --> 15:42.680
I've heard from some developers

15:42.680 --> 15:44.340
and I'm here to, you know,

15:44.800 --> 15:45.860
put my name out there

15:45.860 --> 15:46.940
and hear from more.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.240
I would say we take most

15:48.240 --> 15:48.840
of our guidance

15:48.840 --> 15:50.060
at this time

15:50.060 --> 15:51.500
from First Nations.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.200
So for example,

15:52.360 --> 15:54.140
Union of BC and Indian Chiefs

15:54.140 --> 15:55.060
has come out strongly

15:55.060 --> 15:56.180
on Bill 15

15:56.180 --> 15:57.560
and we believe

15:57.560 --> 15:58.040
that they have,

15:58.260 --> 15:59.920
they really have a strong argument

15:59.920 --> 16:00.740
to make about

16:00.740 --> 16:02.380
the free prior

16:02.380 --> 16:03.120
and informed consent

16:03.120 --> 16:04.500
and participation.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.380
Same with First Nations

16:06.380 --> 16:07.100
Leadership Council

16:07.100 --> 16:08.960
and then when it comes

16:08.960 --> 16:09.480
to some of these

16:09.480 --> 16:10.920
local governments

16:10.920 --> 16:12.240
are also, you know,

16:12.280 --> 16:12.960
throwing up caution.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.200
Not so much

16:14.200 --> 16:15.140
about the renewable energy

16:15.140 --> 16:16.000
Bill 14

16:16.000 --> 16:17.380
but about Bill 15

16:17.380 --> 16:18.680
and the infrastructure

16:18.680 --> 16:20.160
projects in general

16:20.160 --> 16:21.560
kind of steamrolling

16:21.560 --> 16:22.300
little governments

16:22.300 --> 16:24.660
has been done

16:24.660 --> 16:25.180
in the past

16:25.180 --> 16:26.060
and I would argue

16:26.060 --> 16:27.720
it's not good

16:27.720 --> 16:30.180
for the overall process.

16:30.320 --> 16:30.600
I don't think

16:30.600 --> 16:31.280
it's good for business.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.020
I don't think

16:32.020 --> 16:32.920
it's good for,

16:33.020 --> 16:33.220
you know,

16:33.260 --> 16:33.820
public trust

16:33.820 --> 16:35.020
and institutions.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.860
So, yeah,

16:39.020 --> 16:41.140
the people

16:41.140 --> 16:41.820
that we're listening

16:41.820 --> 16:43.140
to are, you know,

16:43.160 --> 16:43.760
to some degree

16:43.760 --> 16:45.060
you're kind of

16:45.060 --> 16:46.940
typical green advisors

16:46.940 --> 16:47.460
but we,

16:47.760 --> 16:48.440
my job,

16:48.940 --> 16:49.120
you know,

16:49.320 --> 16:50.300
I got into this

16:50.300 --> 16:51.200
because I thought

16:51.200 --> 16:51.940
we needed more people

16:51.940 --> 16:53.180
with a technical background,

16:53.340 --> 16:53.740
more engineers

16:53.740 --> 16:54.260
and scientists

16:54.260 --> 16:54.880
and politics

16:54.880 --> 16:55.280
and so

16:55.280 --> 16:57.240
I don't listen

16:57.240 --> 16:58.000
to anybody

16:58.000 --> 16:59.120
and if there's

16:59.120 --> 16:59.540
proponents

16:59.540 --> 17:00.060
that have,

17:00.240 --> 17:00.460
you know,

17:00.500 --> 17:01.340
really strong opinions

17:01.340 --> 17:01.880
about how this

17:01.880 --> 17:02.300
should be done

17:02.300 --> 17:03.120
I would love

17:03.120 --> 17:04.160
to hear from you

17:04.160 --> 17:05.940
and I've got some cards

17:05.940 --> 17:07.780
and you can find me

17:07.780 --> 17:08.580
online

17:08.580 --> 17:09.720
but it is really

17:09.720 --> 17:10.420
important to hear

17:10.420 --> 17:11.580
the people doing it

17:11.580 --> 17:11.920
on the ground

17:11.920 --> 17:12.480
there are people

17:12.480 --> 17:12.800
who are sitting

17:12.800 --> 17:13.220
in offices

17:13.220 --> 17:14.020
as we all know

17:14.020 --> 17:15.220
who haven't done

17:15.220 --> 17:16.020
this work

17:16.020 --> 17:17.200
and they need

17:17.200 --> 17:17.800
to hear from you

17:17.800 --> 17:19.060
and sometimes

17:19.060 --> 17:19.860
that can be

17:19.860 --> 17:21.240
really difficult

17:21.240 --> 17:22.620
to get that message

17:22.620 --> 17:22.860
through

17:22.860 --> 17:25.460
so I'm open

17:25.460 --> 17:27.980
to hearing more

17:27.980 --> 17:29.380
and I think

17:29.380 --> 17:30.380
that's kind of key

17:30.380 --> 17:31.040
that's what government

17:31.040 --> 17:31.720
needs to do too

17:31.720 --> 17:32.200
and sometimes

17:32.200 --> 17:32.800
we get on this

17:32.800 --> 17:34.040
ideological track

17:34.040 --> 17:35.100
and we get tunnel

17:35.100 --> 17:35.620
vision on what

17:35.620 --> 17:36.100
we should do

17:36.100 --> 17:36.820
and we're just

17:36.820 --> 17:37.260
trying to make sure

17:37.260 --> 17:37.800
that doesn't happen.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.820
Thank you very much.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.800
So, I'm afraid

17:41.800 --> 17:42.320
that that's all

17:42.320 --> 17:42.620
the time

17:42.620 --> 17:43.260
that we have.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.080
Jeremy, thank you

17:44.080 --> 17:44.520
so much

17:44.520 --> 17:45.100
for being here today.

17:45.100 --> 17:45.940
we appreciate it.

17:45.940 --> 17:45.980
Thank you.

17:45.980 --> 17:46.880
Thank you.

17:46.880 --> 17:46.940
Thank you.

17:46.940 --> 17:47.020
Thank you.

17:47.020 --> 17:47.100
Thank you.
